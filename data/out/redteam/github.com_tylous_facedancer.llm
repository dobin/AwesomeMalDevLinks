Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- FaceDancer is a Windows exploitation utility for generating hijackable, proxy-based DLLs that execute attacker code while forwarding legitimate exports to the real DLL.  
- It addresses the practical problem of building stable DLL hijacks (avoiding application crashes) by automatically generating export definition (.def) files and proxy stubs.  
- The repo focuses on two main vectors: classic DLL search-order/weak-permission folder hijacking (e.g., user-writable plugin directories) and COM-based system DLL image loading where processes consult HKCU COM registry entries before falling back to machine-wide entries.  
- It supports a recon mode to enumerate exports and generate .def files, and an attack mode to wrap an operator-supplied malicious DLL (containing shellcode/evasion) into a proxying payload.  
- The technique is positioned for low-privilege initial access or persistence, including against WindowsApps-packaged apps like new Outlook/Teams where direct sideloading is difficult but COM loading remains viable.  
- Useful primarily for red teams/pentesters and malware developers; defenders can use it to understand and test detection around COM hijacks and proxy DLL behavior.

Technical Focus:
- DLL proxying via export forwarding using .def files
- DLL hijacking via weak ACLs in user-writable application/plugin directories
- COM hijacking / COM-based DLL loading via HKCU registry precedence
- Shellcode execution from a loaded DLL while maintaining functional pass-through
- Targeting native/WindowsApps processes (e.g., Outlook/Teams) for execution
- Rust-based tooling and build workflow (cargo, cross-compilation target)

Use Cases:
- Generate proxy DLLs to maintain application stability during DLL hijacking
- Abuse user-writable install/plugin paths for code execution without admin rights
- Establish persistence by planting HKCU COM registry entries to redirect DLL loads
- Execute payloads inside high-value processes (Outlook, Explorer, svchost, Edge, Teams)
- Red-team tradecraft development and defensive validation of COM/DLL-load detections
