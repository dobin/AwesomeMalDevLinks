Title:
Cobaltstrike_BOFLoader (Open-source reimplementation of the Cobalt Strike BOF Loader)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
This repository provides an open-source port/reimplementation of Cobalt Strike’s Beacon BOF (Beacon Object File) loader, intentionally mirroring the original behavior “as is.” It targets a common BOF development pain point: BOFs that run in other COFF loaders (e.g., more robust open-source loaders) but fail in Cobalt Strike due to loader quirks and incomplete COFF feature handling (notably COMDAT/section handling). The project also replicates the undocumented Teamserver-side preprocessing that converts a COFF object into a smaller “blob” format delivered to Beacon. Included tooling packs a COFF (.o) into the expected blob and a standalone loader executes it, enabling reproducible debugging outside of Beacon. It’s primarily useful for red team operators and BOF developers who need fidelity with Cobalt Strike’s loader to diagnose edge cases and compatibility issues. Its value is in behavioral parity and debuggability rather than improved stealth or correctness.

Technical Focus:
- Cobalt Strike Beacon BOF loading internals
- COFF object parsing and relocation/application
- Section/COMDAT handling edge cases
- Teamserver-side BOF preprocessing and blob format
- Standalone BOF execution workflow (pack + load)
- Debugging BOF compatibility issues across loaders

Use Cases:
- Reproduce Cobalt Strike-specific BOF failures outside of Beacon for debugging
- Validate whether a BOF incompatibility is due to COFF features (e.g., COMDAT/sections)
- Compare behavior against other COFF loaders to isolate loader implementation differences
- Develop and test BOFs with a loader that matches Cobalt Strike’s quirks
- Reverse/understand the Teamserver “COFF-to-blob” transformation pipeline
