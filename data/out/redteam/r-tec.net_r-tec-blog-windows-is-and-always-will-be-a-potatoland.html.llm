Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
The provided extracted content does not include the actual blog post body; it only shows a marketing section for an “Incident Response Service” (guaranteed response times, readiness planning, monthly retainer, and a prebuilt action plan). Based on the visible text, the page is describing an IR retainer offering rather than technical research. It focuses on operational preparedness: ensuring availability of resources/skills during incidents and reducing response time via pre-defined procedures. This is primarily useful for Blue Teams, SOC/IR leads, and organizations planning incident response coverage. Without the missing article content, no specific Windows “Potato” techniques or security research details can be summarized.

Technical Focus:
- Incident response retainer model
- Guaranteed acceptance/response SLAs
- Incident readiness and pre-incident planning
- Playbooks / Maßnahmenplan (action plan)
- On-call IR staffing and escalation processes

Use Cases:
- Establishing an IR on-call capability with defined SLAs
- Creating and validating incident response playbooks before an incident
- Reducing time-to-triage and time-to-containment via preplanning
- Budgeting IR support as a fixed monthly cost
