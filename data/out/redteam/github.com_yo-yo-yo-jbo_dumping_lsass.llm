Title:
Different ways of dumping LSASS (dumping_lsass)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository is a practical write-up plus C implementations covering multiple techniques to dump `lsass.exe` memory to extract credential material (NTLM hashes, Kerberos tickets, occasional plaintext).  
- It compares “living-off-the-land” approaches (Task Manager, `rundll32 comsvcs.dll MiniDump`, Sysinternals ProcDump) with custom code paths using `MiniDumpWriteDump`, `ReadProcessMemory`, and `PssCaptureSnapshot`.  
- It also details stealthier handle acquisition by duplicating existing LSASS process handles via native APIs (`NtQuerySystemInformation` + `NtDuplicateObject`) to reduce reliance on monitored `OpenProcess` patterns.  
- Two less common dumping paths are included: `SilentProcessExit` (registry-based dump-on-exit via `RtlReportSilentProcessExit`) and “Shtinikering” (abusing Windows Error Reporting over ALPC to generate dumps, requiring SYSTEM).  
- The repo closes with a mitigation overview of LSA Protection (PPL) and Credential Guard (VBS/VTL1), explaining why they break classic LSASS dumping and what broad bypass directions exist.  
- Useful for red teams/pentesters building tradecraft around credential access, and for blue teams mapping detection coverage across multiple LSASS access patterns.

Technical Focus:
- LSASS credential dumping tradecraft and method comparison
- Process handle acquisition: `OpenProcess` vs handle duplication (`NtQuerySystemInformation`, `NtDuplicateObject`, `NtQueryObject`)
- Minidump generation: `MiniDumpWriteDump` (file and in-memory via callbacks)
- Snapshotting and memory reads: `PssCaptureSnapshot`, `ReadProcessMemory`, `VirtualQueryEx`
- WER/ALPC-based dumping (“Shtinikering”) and `SilentProcessExit` registry mechanism
- Mitigations: PPL/RunAsPPL, Credential Guard (VBS, VTL0/VTL1, `lsaiso.exe`)

Use Cases:
- Implement alternative LSASS dumping paths when common tools/APIs are monitored
- Build in-memory minidumps to reduce disk artifacts
- Acquire LSASS handles by duplicating existing handles to evade simplistic `OpenProcess` detections
- Generate dumps via WER or SilentProcessExit for technique diversity in ops/testing
- Defensive testing: validate EDR/SIEM coverage across multiple LSASS access and dump creation methods
