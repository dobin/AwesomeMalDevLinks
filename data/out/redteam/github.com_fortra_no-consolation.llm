No-Consolation

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- No-Consolation is a Cobalt Strike Beacon Object File (BOF) that executes unmanaged Windows PE files (EXEs/DLLs) inline inside the Beacon process and captures their output without allocating a console (avoids spawning `conhost.exe`).  
- It solves the problem of running native tooling while minimizing common telemetry such as new processes/threads and console allocation artifacts.  
- The project implements an in-memory PE loader with options to link the loaded module into the PEB, overwrite PE headers, and custom-load dependencies to reduce image load events.  
- It supports x86/x64, EXE and DLL execution (including selecting an exported function), and can cache/encrypt previously run binaries in memory for reuse without re-uploading.  
- Useful primarily for red teams and pentesters operating in Cobalt Strike who need inline execution tradecraft and controlled output handling.  
- Interesting due to its focus on “no new process/thread” execution, dependency loading control, and operational features like in-memory PE inventory/unload.

Technical Focus:
- Inline PE loading/execution inside an existing process (BOF)
- Console-less output capture via pipes/handle management
- PEB module linking and PE header stomping
- Custom dependency resolution/loading (ApiSet, manual LoadLibrary logic)
- In-memory encrypted PE caching and lifecycle management (list/unload)
- DLL export invocation and (x64) C++ exception support

Use Cases:
- Execute native Windows utilities (e.g., `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`) without spawning `conhost.exe`
- Run third-party EXEs (e.g., credential tools) inline to reduce process-creation telemetry
- Execute DLL payloads by calling `DllMain` or a specific exported function
- Preload and reuse binaries from encrypted in-memory storage to reduce network transfers
- Reduce image load events by custom-loading dependencies and offloading them after execution
