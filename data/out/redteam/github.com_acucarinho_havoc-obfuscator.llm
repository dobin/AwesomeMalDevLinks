Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- A Bash-based automation script that modifies the Havoc C2 framework to reduce obvious fingerprints and improve HTTP(S) traffic realism.  
- It focuses on “rebranding” Havoc by renaming commands/strings (e.g., `Shell` → `MiniMice`, `DotRunner` → `miniMiceDot`) across teamserver, client, and payload code to break simple signature- and heuristic-based detections.  
- The repo also adds IIS 8.5 impersonation behaviors, including removing the `X-Havoc: True` header, and provides a fake IIS-style 404 page to address a redirect/404 edge case (`/` → 301 `/home/` → 404 length 0) that can look suspicious to defenders.  
- Build instructions cover recompiling the Go teamserver and CMake-based client after patching.  
- Notes recommend using malleable profiles (e.g., “windows-update”), avoiding default ports, and using redirectors/proxies to reduce JARM-based fingerprinting.  
- Useful primarily for red teams/pentesters operating Havoc infrastructure and for defenders to understand common Havoc de-fingerprinting patterns.

Technical Focus:
- Havoc C2 source refactoring and string/command renaming
- HTTP header and server fingerprint manipulation (IIS 8.5 impersonation)
- Redirect/404 response behavior shaping for OPSEC
- Malleable C2 profiles (YAOTL) and traffic mimicry
- JARM fingerprinting considerations and use of redirectors
- Go teamserver and CMake client rebuild workflow

Use Cases:
- Automate de-fingerprinting of Havoc deployments before an engagement
- Reduce static detections tied to default Havoc strings/commands/headers
- Make C2 HTTP responses resemble Microsoft IIS behavior for redirectors/frontends
- Patch suspicious web edge cases (redirect → empty 404) that can trigger hunting
- Baseline for defenders to create detections for “rebranded Havoc” variants
