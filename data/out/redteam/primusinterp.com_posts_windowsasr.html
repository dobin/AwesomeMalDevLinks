While working on these engagements i have compiled some tips and tricks in order to bypass/evade some of the rules that ASR offers. In this post i will dive into what ASR is and some of tips and tricks that i often use to bypass/cheese my way around said rules… So strap in and lets get going with some basic ASR understanding.</p><h2 id="the-basics-of-asr"><span class="me-2">The basics of ASR</span><a href="https://primusinterp.com/posts/WindowsASR/#the-basics-of-asr" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>ASR was introduced back in 2017, and its core purpose was to aid organizations in reducing the attack surface of their endpoints running the Microsoft security suite. Microsoft’s approach was to define a ruleset that could be enabled on the endpoints. Each rule focussing on a different attack vector. At the time of this writing the following rules can be enabled in either <em>Block</em>, <em>Audit</em> or <em>Warn</em> mode:</p><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left">Rule ID</th><th style="text-align: left">Rule Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left">56a863a9-875e-4185-98a7-b882c64b5ce5</td><td style="text-align: left">Block abuse of exploited vulnerable signed drivers</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left">7674ba52-37eb-4a4f-a9a1-f0f9a1619a2c</td><td style="text-align: left">Block Adobe Reader from creating child processes</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left">D4F940AB-401B-4EFC-AADC-AD5F3C50688A</td><td style="text-align: left">Block all Office applications from creating child processes</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left">9e6c4e1f-7d60-472f-ba1a-a39ef669e4b2</td><td style="text-align: left">Block credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem (lsass.exe)</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left">BE9BA2D9-53EA-4CDC-84E5-9B1EEEE46550</td><td style="text-align: left">Block executable content from email client and webmail</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left">01443614-cd74-433a-b99e-2ecdc07bfc25</td><td style="text-align: left">Block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criteria</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left">5BEB7EFE-FD9A-4556-801D-275E5FFC04CC</td><td style="text-align: left">Block execution of potentially obfuscated scripts</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left">D3E037E1-3EB8-44C8-A917-57927947596D</td><td style="text-align: left">Block JavaScript or VBScript from launching downloaded executable content</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left">3B576869-A4EC-4529-8536-B80A7769E899</td><td style="text-align: left">Block Office applications from creating executable content</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left">75668C1F-73B5-4CF0-BB93-3ECF5CB7CC84</td><td style="text-align: left">Block Office applications from injecting code into other processes</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left">26190899-1602-49e8-8b27-eb1d0a1ce869</td><td style="text-align: left">Block Office communication applications from creating child processes</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left">e6db77e5-3df2-4cf1-b95a-636979351e5b</td><td style="text-align: left">Block persistence through WMI event subscription</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left">d1e49aac-8f56-4280-b9ba-993a6d77406c</td><td style="text-align: left">Block process creations originating from PSExec and WMI commands</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left">b2b3f03d-6a65-4f7b-a9c7-1c7ef74a9ba4</td><td style="text-align: left">Block untrusted and unsigned processes that run from USB</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left">92E97FA1-2EDF-4476-BDD6-9DD0B4DDDC7B</td><td style="text-align: left">Block Win32 API calls from Office macro</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left">c1db55ab-c21a-4637-bb3f-a12568109d35</td><td style="text-align: left">Use advanced protection against ransomware</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As you can see its quite an extensive list that introduces restrictions on a lot of the areas that is of interest to an adversary.</p><p>ASR introduces another aspect to the concept of defense in depth and compliments the Microsoft security suite very nicely. However, some of these rules can cause disruptions of the legitimate actions or binaries that is needed within a large organizations. This is where exclusions comes into the scene, they can allow an Administrator to introduce exclusions for certain folders or binaries in order to make exemptions for specific tooling, such as in-house developed applications or third-party vendors that have not been validated by Microsoft. However, this is also where it can become quite trivial for attackers to abuse such exclusions in order to bypass some of the ASR rules. This leads us into the next section where we will be covering some bypass techniques in order to circumvent one of the ASR rules.</p><h2 id="common-asr-bypass-techniques-as-low-privileged-user"><span class="me-2">Common ASR bypass techniques as low privileged user</span><a href="https://primusinterp.com/posts/WindowsASR/#common-asr-bypass-techniques-as-low-privileged-user" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>For these specific bypass i will be focusing on the following rule: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">01443614-cd74-433a-b99e-2ecdc07bfc25 - Block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criteria</code>. This rule is often the most disruptive for an attacker or security tester, as it prevents the execution of attacker-controlled binaries that have not been validated or otherwise trusted by Microsoft. This limits the attackers ability to execute tooling on disk for domain enumeration and lateral movement to other parts of the estate.</p><h3 id="exclusions"><span class="me-2">Exclusions</span><a href="https://primusinterp.com/posts/WindowsASR/#exclusions" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Exclusions are by far the easiest and low-effort method of bypassing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Block executable</code> rule.

This allows for quick wins and I have yet to see any security setups where this has generated an alert (yet…). The tool can be found in the following repo that I created for the purpose:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/Primusinterp/PrimusASR">PrimusASR</a></p><p>The tool will generate the following overview upon being executed (I usually just copy paste it directly): <em>Figure 2: ASR exclusion finder tool output</em></p><h4 id="note"><span class="me-2">Note</span><a href="https://primusinterp.com/posts/WindowsASR/#note" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>When I initially found this, I decided to report it to Microsoft (I mean who would want low privileged users to read exclusions, meant only for administrative eyes), but in the expected Microsoft fashion they deemed this to not be a security issue since ASR is not a security boundary:</p><blockquote><p>After thorough investigation, this case does not meet the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) criteria for immediate servicing. This is because Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) is not considered a security boundary for the purposes of immediate servicing, and therefore, access to its exclusions is also not treated as a security boundary under this policy.</p></blockquote><h4 id="recommendations"><span class="me-2">Recommendations</span><a href="https://primusinterp.com/posts/WindowsASR/#recommendations" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>Since Microsoft does not want to do anything about this, the blue folks must take matters into their own hands. The easiest way to combat this is to prevent low privileged users from accessing Windows Event Viewer without a UAC prompt. This would force the attacker down the path of trying to escalate privileges or trying other riskier methods which could result in detection and containment.</p><h3 id="dll-sideloading"><span class="me-2">DLL sideloading</span><a href="https://primusinterp.com/posts/WindowsASR/#dll-sideloading" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>DLL sideloading is another another great option for bypassing the ASR rule <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">01443614-cd74-433a-b99e-2ecdc07bfc25 - Block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criteria</code>. By abusing DLL sideloading, an attacker can use a legitimate trusted binary that meets the rule’s posture checks while loading a malicious DLL that performs the attacker’s intended actions, a good example being a C2 implant. While this post isn’t meant to go in depth on DLL sideloading, I’ll briefly show how it can be used to bypass this rule.</p><p>The first step is to identify a suitable target application. It should either:</p><ul><li>be present on target host as an existing application</li><li>be a portable application that can be transferred to the target machine and pass the ASR posture-checks</li></ul><p>Large, well known software vendors such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GoToMeeting</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Zoom</code> are often good candidates for DLL sideloading, as their binaries are usually trusted, signed, and widely deployed.</p><p>Once a target application has been identified, a tool such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon">Procmon</a> can be used to monitor how it loads DLLs. The goal is to look for DLLs that the application attempts to load but fails to locate because it searches for them using a relative path rather than an absolute path.</p><p>After identifying such a DLL, a proxy DLL can be created that both exposes the required exports (to prevent the application from crashing) and includes the malicious functionality.</p><p>With the proxy DLL in place, the legitimate application can be executed (assuming it passes the ASR posture checks), the malicious DLL will subsequently be loaded while the original application functionality is preserved.</p><p>In the following example, the Microsoft binary <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">at.exe</code> is abused to load a malicious DLL, while ASR correctly blocks the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loader.exe</code> binary from running:</p><p></p><p>In order to learn more about DLL sideloading, I would recommend reading the following blog post by <a href="https://print3m.github.io/blog/dll-sideloading-for-initial-access">Print3M</a>. For the creation of a sideloading DLLs, i would reccomned checking out the tool created by Print3M: <a href="https://github.com/Print3M/DllShimmer">DllShimmer</a>. It allows for easy creation of sideloading DLLs without breaking the original binary.</p><h3 id="signing"><span class="me-2">Signing</span><a href="https://primusinterp.com/posts/WindowsASR/#signing" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>The last and least feasible approach (in my opnion) is to sign the binary that you want to execute with a leaked certificete in order to fool <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trusted criterion and prevalence</code>. This is method is way more finicky to get working and depends on what certifciate that is used to sign the binary. This can lead to a lot of trial and error and is not a recommended approach if you are working a stealthy gig where avoiding detection is paramount in order to reach the objetctives.</p><p>Signing can be done by using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SignTool.exe</code> and a leaked certificate with the following syntax:</p><div class="language-powershell highlighter-rouge"><div class="code-header"> <span data-label-text="Powershell"><i class="fas fa-code fa-fw small"></i></span> <button aria-label="copy" data-title-succeed="Copied!"><i class="far fa-clipboard"></i></button></div><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
