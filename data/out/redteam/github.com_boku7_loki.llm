Title:
Loki Command & Control (Node.js C2 for Script-Jacking Vulnerable Electron Apps)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Loki is a stage-1 C2 framework written in Node.js designed to “script-jack” Electron applications by modifying runtime-loaded JavaScript to execute arbitrary Node code (MITRE ATT&CK T1218.015).  
- It targets trusted, signed Electron apps to evade controls and bypass application allowlisting (notably WDAC) by living inside an allowed binary’s execution context without breaking the app’s code-signing.  
- The framework supports “hollowing” (replacing the app’s resources/app payload) and “backdooring” approaches that can keep the legitimate app functioning while spawning Loki in the background.  
- C2 is implemented via Azure Storage Blobs using SAS tokens, with AES-encrypted messages and a “teamserver-less” design where clients/agents poll the same datastore.  
- Agents are proxy-aware by leveraging Chromium renderer child processes, and include post-exploitation primitives like file ops, process spawn, TCP scanning, shellcode execution, .NET assembly execution, and COFF/BOF execution.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teams and adversary simulation focused on application control bypass and stealthy initial footholds via common Electron software; defenders can use the included detection guidance and Sigma references to hunt for this tradecraft.

Technical Focus:
- Electron application script-jacking (resources/app modification, ASAR/integrity check considerations)
- WDAC / application allowlisting bypass via trusted signed Electron binaries
- Azure Blob Storage C2 (SAS tokens) + AES message encryption
- Proxy-aware execution via Chromium/Electron child processes
- In-process execution: shellcode, .NET inline execution, COFF/BOF loading
- Operational tradecraft: backdooring while preserving app functionality, opsec/detections

Use Cases:
- Establishing an initial foothold by trojanizing a vulnerable Electron desktop app (e.g., Teams/VS Code/Cursor)
- Bypassing Windows Defender Application Control / allowlisting by executing within a trusted signed app
- Covert C2 over common cloud infrastructure (Azure Blob) with encrypted tasking/results
- Post-exploitation tasking: file management, process spawning, internal TCP scanning, DNS lookups
- Running shellcode, .NET assemblies, and BOFs from a Node/Electron context for modular capability
