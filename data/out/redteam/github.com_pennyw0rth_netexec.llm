Title:
NetExec (nxc) – The Network Execution Tool

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
NetExec is a community-maintained fork/continuation of CrackMapExec, focused on automating network-based enumeration and remote execution workflows commonly used in Windows/Active Directory assessments. It streamlines validating credentials (plaintext, hashes, Kerberos), enumerating services and domain information, and executing actions over common enterprise protocols. The project is Python-based and heavily leverages Impacket-style protocol implementations to interact with SMB/RPC/WinRM and related Windows services at scale. It’s primarily useful for red teams and pentesters performing lateral movement, credential spraying/validation, and post-compromise enumeration across many hosts. It’s interesting because it consolidates a large set of AD tradecraft into a single CLI with modular functionality and active community development after the original CME maintenance changes.

Technical Focus:
- SMB/RPC-based remote operations and enumeration
- Active Directory authentication (NTLM, Kerberos) and credential validation
- Lateral movement primitives (remote command execution via Windows management protocols)
- Network-wide scanning/orchestration and target batching
- Impacket-based protocol interaction and tooling ecosystem integration

Use Cases:
- Validate domain/local credentials or NTLM hashes across many hosts (spray/verify)
- Enumerate SMB shares, sessions, local admins, and domain-related host info
- Execute remote commands/actions over SMB/WMI/WinRM-style channels (where permitted)
- Identify reachable services and prioritize lateral movement paths in AD environments
- Automate repeatable post-compromise checks during internal engagements
