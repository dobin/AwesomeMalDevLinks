Title:
PipeViewer (CyberArk) — Windows Named Pipe Permission & Metadata Viewer

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
PipeViewer is a Windows GUI tool for enumerating named pipes and displaying detailed metadata and security permissions (DACL/SD) to identify weak or misconfigured access controls. It helps security researchers and operators quickly spot pipes that are writable/connectable by low-privileged users, which can enable local privilege escalation, impersonation, or service abuse. The project was released alongside CyberArk research on Docker Desktop named-pipe attack surface and related privilege escalation paths. It includes filtering/highlighting, row marking, JSON export/import for offline analysis, and a “PipeChat” feature to connect to available pipes for basic interaction/testing. The tool relies on NtApiDotNet/NtObjectManager-style APIs for NT object inspection, which may trigger Microsoft Defender alerts due to common dual-use tooling signatures. Useful for red teams/pentesters validating escalation primitives and for blue teams auditing endpoints for insecure pipe ACLs.

Technical Focus:
- Windows Named Pipes enumeration and inspection
- Security descriptors, DACLs, and permission analysis on pipe objects
- NT object manager / NtApiDotNet-based querying
- Discovery of privilege escalation primitives via IPC misconfigurations
- JSON export/import for pipe inventory and triage
- Interactive pipe connectivity/testing (“PipeChat”)

Use Cases:
- Audit endpoints for named pipes with overly permissive ACLs (e.g., Everyone/Users write access)
- Triage Docker Desktop / developer tooling IPC surfaces for escalation opportunities
- Validate and reproduce named-pipe abuse scenarios during internal assessments
- Build a baseline inventory of named pipes and diff across hosts/builds via JSON export
- Support defensive hardening by identifying services exposing risky pipe permissions
