Title:
bound — Firewall-rule based “AV blinding” PoC

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- `bound` is a C++ proof-of-concept that attempts to “blind” AV/EDR products by blocking their outbound network connections via Windows Firewall rules.  
- It enumerates active network connections using WMI, maps connections back to owning process IDs, resolves process image paths, and then creates outbound-block rules targeting the process and remote IP range.  
- The workflow is: enumerate connections → identify target processes (e.g., `svchost.exe`) → filter matching connections → add Windows Firewall with Advanced Security rules for those endpoints.  
- This is primarily useful for red teamers/pentesters and malware developers exploring defense evasion via host-based egress control and security-tool disruption.  
- It’s interesting because it operationalizes a simple but impactful idea: degrading security telemetry and cloud lookups (updates, reputation checks, sample submission) by cutting off network access at the local firewall layer.

Technical Focus:
- WMI-based network connection enumeration
- Process-to-connection correlation (PID ownership)
- Process image path resolution
- IP-to-CIDR range conversion for rule scoping
- Windows Firewall with Advanced Security (WFAS) rule creation APIs
- Outbound egress blocking as defense evasion

Use Cases:
- Disrupt AV/EDR cloud reputation queries and telemetry by blocking outbound traffic
- Create targeted egress-deny rules for specific security agent processes
- Post-compromise tradecraft to reduce detection/response signaling
- Lab research on how security products behave when network-isolated
- Defensive testing: validate monitoring/alerts for unauthorized firewall rule changes
