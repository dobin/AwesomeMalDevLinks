Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
TopazTerminator is a C proof-of-concept that abuses the signed-but-vulnerable `wsftprm.sys` (Topaz Antifraud kernel driver) to terminate arbitrary processes on Windows, including protected/PPL security processes. It demonstrates a BYOVD-style technique where an attacker loads a legitimate signed driver and triggers a dangerous IOCTL path that ultimately calls `ZwOpenProcess` and `ZwTerminateProcess`. The README focuses on reversing the driver’s non-standard IOCTL dispatch logic (a subtraction chain instead of a switch) to derive the required IOCTL (`0x22201C`) and input buffer length (1036 bytes). As of Jan 2026, the referenced driver hash is claimed to not yet be on Microsoft’s Vulnerable Driver Blocklist, making it operationally relevant until blocked. This is primarily useful for red teams, pentesters, and malware developers evaluating EDR/AV tamper resistance and driver-blocking controls. It’s interesting because it provides a clear, minimal implementation and reverse-engineering notes for reaching a kernel-assisted process kill primitive.

Technical Focus:
- BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) for security product tampering
- Windows kernel driver IOCTL reverse engineering and dispatch logic
- IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL handling and DeviceIoControl triggering
- Process termination via `ZwOpenProcess` + `ZwTerminateProcess`
- PPL (Protected Process Light) termination implications
- Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist / driver reputation controls

Use Cases:
- Terminate EDR/AV agents during post-exploitation to enable follow-on actions
- Validate effectiveness of WDAC/HVCI/driver blocklist enforcement in an environment
- Reproduce and study a kernel-assisted process-kill primitive for detection engineering
- Assess monitoring opportunities around suspicious driver loading + IOCTL usage
