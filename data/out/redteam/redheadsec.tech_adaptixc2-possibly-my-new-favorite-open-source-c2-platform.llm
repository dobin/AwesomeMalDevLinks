Title:
AdaptixC2 – Possibly My New Favorite Open-Source C2 Platform

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post reviews AdaptixC2 v0.5, an open-source command-and-control framework with a Golang teamserver and a cross-platform Qt GUI client.  
- It walks through setup via a JSON “server profile” that defines the teamserver endpoint, auth, TLS certs, loaded extenders (listeners/agents), and default server response behavior.  
- The author demonstrates creating HTTP and TCP (“Gopher”) listeners, generating agents (exe/dll/shellcode/service exe depending on agent type), and using built-in operator features like file/process browsers, tasking, downloads, screenshots, and session graphing.  
- Pivoting capabilities are highlighted via SMB linking (peer-to-peer style) plus SOCKS4/5 proxies and local/reverse port forwarding for internal access.  
- A key focus is extensibility: loading the Adaptix Extension-Kit and building custom commands that wrap Beacon Object Files (BOFs), with a preview of the newer AxScript extension language introduced in v0.7.  
- It’s most useful for red teams and pentesters wanting a GUI-driven, modular C2 with BOF-based post-exploitation workflows, while noting default agents are not “OPSEC safe” without custom evasion/loader work.

Technical Focus:
- Modular C2 architecture (server profiles, extenders/plugins for listeners and agents)
- Cross-platform agents and transport options (HTTP Beacon, TCP Gopher, SMB link/pivot)
- Encrypted communications, TLS/mTLS certificate handling
- Post-exploitation features: SOCKS proxying, port forwarding, tunneling, session graph
- BOF integration and extension development (Extension-Kit, AxScript/ASX command wrappers)
- Operator UX: GUI tasking, jobs storage, file/process browsing, screenshots

Use Cases:
- Deploy a teamserver with multiple listener types and manage multi-operator sessions
- Generate and task Windows/Linux/macOS agents from a single GUI
- Establish SOCKS5 pivoting and port forwards for internal network access
- Reduce egress by linking/pivoting via SMB between agents
- Extend capability by wrapping existing BOFs into custom Adaptix commands (AxScript/ASX)
