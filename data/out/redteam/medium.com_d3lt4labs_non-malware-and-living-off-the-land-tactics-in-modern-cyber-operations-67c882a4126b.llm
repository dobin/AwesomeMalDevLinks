Title:
Non-Malware and Living-off-the-Land Tactics in Modern Cyber Operations

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This article surveys “non-malware” / Living-off-the-Land (LoTL) tradecraft where adversaries abuse built-in OS and enterprise tools instead of deploying custom binaries.  
- It explains why signature/IOC-driven defenses fail against trusted, signed utilities (LOLbins) and argues for behavior-based detection, baselining, and threat-hunting.  
- The post traces LoTL’s evolution from niche APT usage to mainstream adoption by financially motivated groups and hacktivists, including cloud services as covert C2.  
- It provides case studies (APT29, Turla, APT34/OilRig, FIN7/Carbanak) and ties common techniques to MITRE ATT&CK (execution, persistence, defense evasion, credential access, lateral movement).  
- Practical detection guidance is included via Windows event IDs (e.g., 4104, 4688, 4698, 7045, 5861) and example hunting queries for PowerShell, certutil, procdump, and log clearing.  
- Useful for SOC analysts, threat hunters, CTI teams, and red teams doing adversary emulation to validate detections around native-tool abuse.

Technical Focus:
- LOLBins / signed binary proxy execution (rundll32, regsvr32, mshta, certutil)
- PowerShell tradecraft and logging (Script Block Logging, suspicious flags, AMSI context)
- WMI for remote execution and persistence (event consumers/subscriptions)
- Credential dumping via legitimate tooling (ProcDump targeting LSASS)
- Lateral movement via remote services (PsExec, WinRM, RDP/SMB)
- IOC vs IOA shift; behavioral detection and baselining

Use Cases:
- Build threat-hunting playbooks for LoTL behaviors (PowerShell, WMI, certutil, regsvr32)
- Map observed activity to MITRE ATT&CK for reporting and detection coverage gaps
- Create SIEM/EDR detections using command-line + parent/child + event ID correlations
- Adversary emulation exercises to test SOC visibility and reduce false positives
- Hardening/monitoring guidance for admin-tool abuse (logging enablement, baselines)
