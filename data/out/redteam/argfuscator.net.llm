Title:
ArgFuscator (Command/Argument Obfuscation Generator)

Type:
Other (Web Tool)

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- ArgFuscator is a web-based tool that mutates command-line invocations by obfuscating program arguments, file paths, and URLs while aiming to preserve the command’s functional outcome.  
- It targets a common detection surface: static or brittle parsing of command-lines by EDR/SIEM rules, allow/deny lists, and simplistic regex-based detections.  
- The site provides templates for many common Windows, Linux, and macOS utilities (including many “living off the land” binaries) and applies configurable transformations with probabilities.  
- Techniques include character insertion, quote insertion, random casing, option-character substitution, argument reordering, shorthand/alias swapping, regex-based rewrites, path transformations (slashes, traversal, extra slashes), and URL mangling (protocol omission, alternate slashes, alternate IP forms, traversal).  
- It’s useful for red teams/pentesters to generate evasive-but-valid command lines for testing detections, and for blue teams to harden parsing and normalization in telemetry pipelines.  
- The interesting value is in systematically exploring how normalization gaps and argument parsing edge-cases can break detections without changing underlying behavior.

Technical Focus:
- Command-line obfuscation and mutation strategies
- Argument parsing edge-cases (quotes, casing, option variants)
- File path canonicalization bypasses (slashes, traversal, redundant separators)
- URL normalization bypasses (protocol variants, alternate IP representations)
- Detection engineering robustness testing (regex brittleness, normalization)

Use Cases:
- Generate obfuscated LOLBin/LOLBAS command lines to test EDR/SIEM detections
- Fuzz command-line parsing/normalization logic in security products and pipelines
- Build more resilient detection rules by identifying equivalent command variants
- Create test corpora for command-line analytics and normalization unit tests
