Title:
Cobalt Strike, a Defender’s Guide (Part 1)

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post breaks down common Cobalt Strike tradecraft observed in real intrusions and maps it to practical detection opportunities.  
- It covers how attackers deploy and operate Beacons (often after initial access via droppers like IcedID, Qbot, TrickBot, etc.), and why malleable C2 profiles and redirectors complicate infrastructure-based blocking.  
- The author highlights host-based artifacts such as `rundll32.exe`-driven post-ex DLL execution, default named pipe patterns, and common staging methods (encoded PowerShell in-memory injection, download-and-execute, and in-memory execution by initial malware).  
- It also details telemetry and event IDs useful for hunting key behaviors: process injection, discovery via LOLBins, privilege escalation (GetSystem and service creation), credential access (LSASS access, Mimikatz, DCSync), and lateral movement (psexec/WinRM/WMI, pass-the-hash, remote service creation).  
- Network detection angles include HTTP/HTTPS/DNS beaconing patterns, certificate/JA3/JA3S/JARM fingerprinting, and malleable profile indicators (e.g., fake jQuery traffic).  
- Useful for blue teams (threat hunting/detection engineering/DFIR) and red teams validating OPSEC against common detections.

Technical Focus:
- Malleable C2 profiles, redirectors, and C2 fingerprinting (JA3/JA3S/JARM, TLS cert traits)
- Beacon execution artifacts (rundll32, temporary processes, named pipes)
- Sysmon + Windows Security event ID mapping for post-ex behaviors
- Process injection techniques (CreateRemoteThread, hollowing) and detection telemetry
- Credential access (LSASS dumping, Mimikatz, DCSync) and lateral movement (psexec/WMI/WinRM, PTH)
- Detection content references (Sigma rules, Suricata/ET signatures)

Use Cases:
- Build hunts/detections for Cobalt Strike across execution, injection, and lateral movement phases
- Tune Sysmon configuration (named pipes, process access, remote thread creation) for higher-fidelity alerts
- Identify likely Cobalt Strike C2 via TLS/cert/JA3/JARM and malleable-profile network patterns
- Create incident response checklists keyed to specific Windows/Sysmon event IDs
- Red-team OPSEC review: validate whether default CS artifacts (pipes, rundll32 patterns, service exec naming) are exposed
