Title:
ChromeAlone – A Browser C2 Framework (Transforming Chromium into a C2 Implant)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- ChromeAlone is an offensive framework that turns a victim’s Chromium-based browser into a full C2 “implant,” positioning the browser itself as the execution and persistence substrate.  
- It aims to replace conventional agents (e.g., Cobalt Strike/Meterpreter) by using a malicious Chrome Extension plus a malicious Isolated Web App (IWA) to provide C2, SOCKS proxying, data theft, and host interaction.  
- The repo includes an end-to-end toolchain: infrastructure deployment (Terraform to AWS), a relay/management component, a web-based operator console, and PowerShell sideloaders to install the extension/IWA on Windows targets.  
- Capabilities include session/cookie/history theft, credential capture, file reads, command execution via a Native Messaging host, and WebAuthn phishing techniques targeting hardware tokens.  
- A key theme is “EDR-resistant” persistence and functionality implemented largely via built-in Chromium features and web tech (including WASM), reducing reliance on traditional suspicious process injection patterns.  
- Useful primarily for red teams and adversary emulation; also valuable to blue teams for understanding and detecting browser-as-implant tradecraft.

Technical Focus:
- Chromium extension abuse and sideloading workflows
- Isolated Web Apps (IWA) and Direct Sockets permissions
- Native Messaging host integration for OS command execution
- Browser data theft (cookies/history/credentials) and session hijacking
- WebAuthn phishing via iframe/content-script techniques
- C2 relay + operator web UI + per-agent SOCKS proxying (AWS/Terraform)

Use Cases:
- Deploying a browser-resident C2 channel in environments with strong EDR controls
- Establishing internal pivoting via per-host SOCKS5 proxies
- Harvesting browser sessions/cookies for account takeover and lateral movement
- Capturing credentials and browser-stored secrets during red team ops
- Phishing/abusing WebAuthn flows to target hardware-backed authentication
- Testing detections for malicious extensions, IWA abuse, and Chrome persistence artifacts
