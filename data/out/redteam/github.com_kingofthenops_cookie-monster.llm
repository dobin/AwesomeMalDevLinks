Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
Cookie-Monster is a Cobalt Strike Beacon Object File (BOF) that steals browser cookies and saved credentials from Chromium-based browsers (Chrome/Edge) and Firefox. It extracts Chromium’s WebKit Master Key and the newer App-Bound Encryption Key, then locates a running browser process that already has handles open to the Cookies/Login Data SQLite files, duplicates those handles, and performs “fileless” retrieval of the databases. A companion Python script decrypts the downloaded databases into usable cookies/passwords and can export to formats compatible with tools like Cookie-Editor and CuddlePhish. The repo tracks Chromium changes (e.g., v20 cookies and Chrome/Edge 127+ / Chrome 137+ decryption changes) and includes a mode to decrypt app-bound keys as SYSTEM without injecting into the browser (using Local State + PID impersonation). It’s primarily useful for red teams and pentesters performing post-compromise session hijacking and credential harvesting, and it’s interesting because it operationalizes modern Chromium cookie encryption/key retrieval constraints and handle-based file acquisition.

Technical Focus:
- Cobalt Strike BOF development (C, beacon.h)  
- Chromium cookie/password encryption (WebKit Master Key, App-Bound Encryption Key, v20 cookies)  
- Handle enumeration/duplication to access locked SQLite DBs (Cookies, Login Data)  
- Fileless file acquisition techniques (handle-based copying)  
- DPAPI/Windows key protection and impersonation for decryption contexts  
- Firefox profile discovery (profiles.ini) and artifact collection (logins.json, key4.db)

Use Cases:
- Post-exploitation extraction of Chrome/Edge cookies for session takeover
- Dumping Chromium “Login Data” to recover saved passwords offline
- Collecting Firefox credential artifacts for offline decryption workflows
- Generating cookie exports for Cookie-Editor import or CuddlePhish automation
- Operating in environments where browser DB files are locked (live handle duplication)
