Title:
Customizing Sliver – Part 3

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post is the final part of a series showing how to extend the Sliver C2 framework by adding a custom operator command end-to-end.  
- It walks through implementing a simple `helloworld` command that accepts positional/flag parameters in the client, sends them via gRPC/protobuf to the server, forwards the task to the implant, and prints the implant’s response back in the console.  
- The tutorial covers defining new protobuf messages and RPC methods, regenerating Go bindings (`make pb`), wiring a Cobra CLI command, and adding a server-side RPC handler using Sliver’s `GenericHandler`.  
- On the implant side it demonstrates adding a new task handler, registering it in the per-OS handler maps, and extending Sliver’s message ID constants and `MsgNumber()` switch safely (append-only).  
- It includes practical debugging workflow across client/server/implant (VSCode + Delve) and highlights async beacon task handling vs interactive sessions.  
- Useful for red teamers and toolsmiths who want to customize Sliver implants/operators, and for defenders/researchers studying how Sliver’s tasking pipeline is structured.

Technical Focus:
- Protobuf schema design and Go code generation (protoc, `make pb`)
- gRPC RPC method integration in Sliver (services.proto, server RPC handlers)
- Sliver client command development (Cobra, flags, console RPC calls)
- Implant task handler implementation and registration (handler maps, OS-specific files)
- Sliver message numbering/constants (`MsgHelloWorldReq`, `MsgNumber()` dispatch)
- Debugging distributed Go components with VSCode + Delve (dlv), async beacon callbacks

Use Cases:
- Add bespoke operator commands to Sliver for internal tradecraft
- Prototype new implant capabilities and validate client/server/implant plumbing
- Implement and test new tasking flows for sessions vs beacons (async responses)
- Create organization-specific post-exploitation modules (e.g., token vault exercise)
- Learn Sliver’s internal architecture for auditing, research, or detection engineering
