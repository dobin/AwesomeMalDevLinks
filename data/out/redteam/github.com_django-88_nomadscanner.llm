Title:
NomadScanner – Stealth Portscanner for Red Teams

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
NomadScanner is a Windows-based, C-written “memory-only” port scanner designed for stealthy reconnaissance during red team operations. It focuses on minimizing host artifacts (no file output) and blending network traffic by sending randomized HTTP probes (method, User-Agent, padding) with configurable jitter. The tool supports IPv4/IPv6, multithreaded scanning, banner grabbing, port range parsing with exclusions, and optional domain fronting via a custom `Host:` header. It also exposes network-level evasion knobs such as randomized ephemeral source ports, TTL/hop-limit variation, TOS/traffic-class changes, DF/DONTFRAG control, TCP window tuning, and `TCP_NODELAY`. It’s primarily useful for red teamers and penetration testers who need OPSEC-conscious service discovery on Windows. The interesting aspect is the combination of application-layer probe randomization with low-level socket option tuning to reduce simple signature- and heuristic-based detections.

Technical Focus:
- Windows Winsock networking (`ws2_32`), socket option tuning
- Stealthy port scanning via HTTP-based probes and banner grabbing
- Traffic randomization (jitter, headers, padding, User-Agent rotation)
- IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack scanning using `getaddrinfo`
- Domain fronting / `Host:` header override
- Concurrency (multithreading) and in-memory logging/output buffering

Use Cases:
- Stealthy internal network port/service discovery from a Windows foothold
- Identifying HTTP-speaking services and collecting response banners
- Blending recon traffic into “normal” web-like patterns using randomized probes
- Scanning dual-stack (IPv4/IPv6) environments with per-family socket behavior
- Domain-fronted HTTP probing where SNI/Host-based routing is relevant (Host header override)
