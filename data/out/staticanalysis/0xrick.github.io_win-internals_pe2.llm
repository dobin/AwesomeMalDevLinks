Title:
A dive into the PE file format – PE file structure (Part 1: Overview)

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post provides a high-level introduction to the Windows Portable Executable (PE) format and its role in enabling the OS loader to map and execute binaries.  
- It clarifies that PE applies to more than `.exe` files (e.g., `.dll`, kernel modules, `.cpl`) and is derived from COFF.  
- The article walks through the top-level PE layout: DOS Header, DOS Stub, NT Headers (PE signature, COFF File Header, Optional Header), Section Table, and Sections.  
- It briefly explains what each component is for (e.g., DOS stub message, Optional Header being critical for image files, section headers describing each section).  
- Useful for reverse engineers, malware analysts, exploit developers, and defenders who need foundational PE structure knowledge for parsing, triage, and detection engineering.  
- Interesting as a baseline primer before deeper work on PE parsing, manual mapping, packers, and header/section tampering.

Technical Focus:
- PE/COFF file format fundamentals  
- DOS Header and DOS Stub purpose  
- NT Headers: PE signature, File Header, Optional Header  
- Section Table (IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER array)  
- Sections and their role in code/data/resource storage  
- Basic tooling view (PE-bear)

Use Cases:
- Rapid triage of suspicious Windows binaries by inspecting headers/sections  
- Building or validating PE parsers for tooling and automation  
- Supporting reverse engineering and malware unpacking workflows  
- Understanding common manipulation points for evasion (header/section anomalies)  
- Preparing for deeper topics like manual mapping and loader behavior
