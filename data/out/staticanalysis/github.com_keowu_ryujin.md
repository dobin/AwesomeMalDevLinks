# Ryūjin Protector

[Permalink: Ryūjin Protector](https://github.com/keowu/Ryujin#ry%C5%ABjin-protector)

**Ryūjin Protector** is an open-source Bin2Bin obfuscation, protection, and DRM tool for Windows PE binaries targeting the Intel x64 architecture (x86\_64 only).

[![Ryūjin Protector Banner](https://github.com/keowu/Ryujin/raw/main/imgs/ryujinreadme.png)](https://github.com/keowu/Ryujin/blob/main/imgs/ryujinreadme.png)

* * *

## Overview

[Permalink: Overview](https://github.com/keowu/Ryujin#overview)

Ryūjin is a research-grade protector and obfuscator built to explore Bin2Bin transformation techniques. It is suitable for security researchers, reverse engineers, anti-cheat and anti-tamper developers, and others studying binary protection. Ryūjin focuses on transforming binaries while preserving original program semantics.

* * *

## Features

[Permalink: Features](https://github.com/keowu/Ryujin#features)

- Junk code insertion and code mutation (randomized while preserving original logic)
- IAT call access obfuscation (with obfuscated handler access)
- Random section naming (default: `Ryujin`)
- Mathematical operator virtualization (Ryūjin MiniVM)
- Mathematical operator virtualization with Hyper-V isolation (MiniVM + Hyper-V)
- Encrypted code sections (TeaDelKew algorithm)
- Anti-debug (user-mode and kernel-mode)
- TrollReversers (can induce BSOD during reversing attempts)
- Anti-dump protections
- Anti-disassembly and anti-decompiler techniques
- Memory integrity protection (CRC32-based)
- Custom pass support (includes **MBA-linear Obfuscation Pass** and community passes)
- And more, see the wiki for a complete list

* * *

## Demos and Presentations

[Permalink: Demos and Presentations](https://github.com/keowu/Ryujin#demos-and-presentations)

Ryūjin is intended primarily as a study and research tool. Below are small demos showing a `main` function before and after a Ryūjin pass:

[![Ryūjin Protector Demo](https://github.com/keowu/Ryujin/raw/main/imgs/demo.png)](https://github.com/keowu/Ryujin/blob/main/imgs/demo.png)

> This demo shows one feature; combining multiple features produces stronger obfuscation. See the Ryūjin Wiki for full examples and explanations.

### Modes of use

[Permalink: Modes of use](https://github.com/keowu/Ryujin#modes-of-use)

Ryūjin supports both CLI and GUI:

- **CLI:** Full functionality and advanced options for expert/research users.
- **GUI:** Simplified interface for quick runs (requires `wxWidgets`).

CLI demo:
[![Ryūjin Protector Demo Console](https://github.com/keowu/Ryujin/raw/main/imgs/demo2.png)](https://github.com/keowu/Ryujin/blob/main/imgs/demo2.png)

GUI demo:
[![Ryūjin Protector Demo GUI](https://github.com/keowu/Ryujin/raw/main/imgs/demo1.png)](https://github.com/keowu/Ryujin/blob/main/imgs/demo1.png)

**Input requirements:** a PE executable (EXE) for x64 and its PDB file containing symbols. The PDB is required to enable several transformation passes that rely on symbol information.

* * *

## Custom Pass Support

[Permalink: Custom Pass Support](https://github.com/keowu/Ryujin#custom-pass-support)

Ryūjin supports custom passes through a simple callback model. A custom pass receives a `RyujinProcedure` instance and can modify basic blocks, scopes, or other procedure-level structures.

Example callback signature:

```
void RyujinCustomPassDemo(RyujinProcedure* proc);
```

See the class definition here:

**[RyujinProcedure.hh](https://github.com/keowu/Ryujin/blob/main/RyujinCore/Ryujin/Models/RyujinProcedure.hh).**

Example usage is included here:

**[RyujinCustomPasses.hh](https://github.com/keowu/Ryujin/blob/main/RyujinConsole/RyujinConsole/RyujinCustomPasses.hh#L11).**

No additional configuration changes are required. `RyujinObfuscatorConfig` already exposes the settings needed to register and run custom passes.
