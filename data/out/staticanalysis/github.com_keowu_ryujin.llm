Title:
Ryūjin Protector (Ryujin) — Windows PE x64 Bin2Bin Obfuscation/Protection/DRM

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Ryūjin is an open-source “bin2bin” protector that transforms existing Windows PE x64 executables while preserving program semantics, aiming to increase reverse-engineering cost.  
- It provides multiple protection passes such as junk code insertion/mutation, IAT call obfuscation, encrypted code sections, anti-debug/anti-dump, anti-disassembly/decompiler tricks, and integrity checks.  
- A notable focus is arithmetic/operator virtualization via a “MiniVM,” with an option to isolate virtualization using Hyper-V.  
- The project is research-oriented and includes a companion write-up/paper describing how the obfuscator is built and how it can be fully deobfuscated, making it relevant to both offense and defense.  
- It supports both CLI and GUI workflows and exposes a custom-pass API to implement new transformations (e.g., MBA-linear obfuscation).  
- Useful for reverse engineers and malware analysts (understanding protected samples), as well as red teams/malware dev/anti-tamper developers experimenting with PE-level obfuscation techniques.

Technical Focus:
- Windows PE x64 bin2bin rewriting and code transformation passes  
- Control-flow/code mutation and junk instruction insertion  
- IAT/API call obfuscation and handler indirection  
- Code section encryption and runtime decryption stubs  
- Virtualization-based obfuscation (MiniVM) + Hyper-V isolation  
- Anti-analysis: anti-debug, anti-dump, anti-disassembly/decompiler, integrity (CRC32)

Use Cases:
- Protecting/redacting proprietary Windows x64 tooling against static analysis
- Generating obfuscated binaries for AV/EDR evaluation and research
- Studying modern protector design (PE rewriting, VM-based obfuscation, encryption stubs)
- Building custom obfuscation passes for experimentation (via callback model)
- Blue-team/malware-analysis practice on protected binaries using the accompanying deobfuscation write-up
