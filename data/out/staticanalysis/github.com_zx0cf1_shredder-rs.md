# Shredder-RS

[Permalink: Shredder-RS](https://github.com/zx0CF1/shredder-rs#shredder-rs)

A polymorphic mutation engine for x86\_64 binaries.

## Overview

[Permalink: Overview](https://github.com/zx0CF1/shredder-rs#overview)

Shredder-RS implements instruction-level shredding to defeat static analysis. By breaking the linear flow of the code and injecting randomized junk nodes, it forces disassemblers to follow a complex graph of JMP-linked instructions.

## Core Mechanism: Instruction Shredding

[Permalink: Core Mechanism: Instruction Shredding](https://github.com/zx0CF1/shredder-rs#core-mechanism-instruction-shredding)

Unlike basic obfuscators that only add junk code, **Shredder-RS** deconstructs the original instruction stream into isolated functional nodes.

1. **Decoding:** Full x86\_64 disassembly using `iced-x86`.
2. **Fragmentation:** Each instruction is wrapped in a "Mutation Node".
3. **Entropy Injection:** Nodes are physically shuffled in a new PE section.
4. **Control Flow Linking:** Nodes are re-connected via relative jumps, creating a "spaghetti" CFG (Control Flow Graph) that disrupts linear sweep disassemblers.

## Key Features

[Permalink: Key Features](https://github.com/zx0CF1/shredder-rs#key-features)

- **Context-Aware Mutation:** Preserves EFLAGS and volatile registers via context-sandwiching (Push/Popfq).
- **Non-Linear Layout:** Randomized physical instruction placement to defeat pattern matching.
- **PE Support:** Automated section injection (`.shred`) and EntryPoint hijacking.
