Title:
PERSES — X86 Mutation Engine with Portable Executable (PE) compatibility

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- PERSES is a Windows-focused x86/x64 code mutation (obfuscation) engine that operates directly on Portable Executable (PE) binaries.  
- It replaces selected instructions with larger, semantically equivalent instruction sequences to degrade disassembly/decompilation quality and complicate static analysis.  
- The project currently mutates a small set of instructions but aims to have outsized impact on analyzers due to how the mutations are constructed (including optional randomized control-flow via RET gadget pools).  
- Target locations can be specified by raw addresses, symbol names via linked MAP files (IDA/MSVC), function range lists, or via embedded “marker” patterns emitted by a provided SDK header.  
- It’s primarily useful for red team tool developers, malware analysts/researchers, and reverse engineers studying decompiler failure modes and PE rewriting.  
- Interesting aspects include PE-aware rewriting, integration with disassembly/assembly libraries (Zydis/AsmJit), and a schema-based transform pipeline that can be extended.

Technical Focus:
- PE binary rewriting and code transformation
- x86/x64 instruction mutation (semantic equivalence)
- Disassembly/assembly pipelines (Zydis, AsmJit)
- Symbol resolution via MAP files (IDA Pro/MSVC)
- Marker-based region selection using compiler intrinsics
- RET gadget pool generation for control-flow randomization

Use Cases:
- Obfuscate selected functions/regions in a Windows PE for anti-reversing experiments
- Evaluate how decompilers/analyzers break under specific mutation patterns
- Apply targeted transformations using symbols (MAP) or explicit address ranges
- Embed mutation markers in source code and post-process compiled binaries
- Extend/author new mutation schemas for custom transforms
