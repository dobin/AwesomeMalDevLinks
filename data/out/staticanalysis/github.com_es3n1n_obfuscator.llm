Title:
es3n1n/obfuscator (PE/ELF bin2bin native code obfuscator)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository provides a C++23 “bin2bin” obfuscator that rewrites compiled native binaries rather than source code.  
- It targets PE executables (Windows) and also supports ELF, aiming to make reverse engineering and static analysis harder.  
- Implemented transforms include bogus control flow, constant encryption (“constant crypt”), instruction/substitution-style rewriting, and decompilation breakers aimed at tools like IDA and Ghidra.  
- The tool is configured via CLI with per-function and per-transform settings, and supports specifying PDB/MAP paths for symbol/mapping assistance during rewriting.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teams, malware developers, and reverse-engineering researchers evaluating obfuscation resilience and analysis tooling limitations.  
- The project includes a linked write-up (part 1) describing design/implementation details and emphasizes reproducibility via logged random seeds for bug reports.

Technical Focus:
- Binary-to-binary (bin2bin) rewriting for PE and ELF
- Bogus control flow insertion
- Constant encryption/encoding (“constant crypt”)
- Decompilation-breaking patterns (IDA/Ghidra)
- Substitution/instruction-level transformations
- Build/tooling: CMake, C++23, PDB/MAP handling

Use Cases:
- Obfuscating Windows PE or Linux ELF payloads post-compilation
- Generating harder-to-decompile samples for RE/DFIR tool testing
- Evaluating EDR/static detection robustness against obfuscated binaries
- Researching decompiler failure modes and control-flow recovery limits
- Reproducible obfuscation experiments using logged RNG seeds
