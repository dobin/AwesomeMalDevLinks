Title:
EMBER2024 — A Benchmark Dataset for Holistic Evaluation of Malware Classifiers

Type:
Research Paper

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This paper introduces EMBER2024, a large public benchmark dataset intended to make malware ML research more reproducible and more representative of real-world detection challenges.  
- It contains metadata, hashes, EMBER v3 feature vectors, and labels/tags for ~3.2M files collected from VirusTotal (Sep 2023–Dec 2024) across six formats: Win32, Win64, .NET, APK, ELF, and PDF.  
- The dataset supports seven classification tasks including malware detection, malware family classification, and multi-label attribute prediction (behaviors, packers, exploited vulns, threat groups).  
- A key contribution is a “challenge set” (~6.3K samples) of malware that initially had 0/≈70 AV detections but became detectable after later rescans, enabling evaluation against evasive/initially-undetected malware.  
- The authors also release code to reproduce the dataset construction pipeline (VT queries, dedup via TLSH, labeling) and provide baseline LightGBM models; results show strong standard test performance but significant degradation on the challenge set and on newly emerging families.  
- Useful for malware ML researchers, red teams evaluating static ML brittleness/evasion, and blue teams benchmarking model robustness and drift.

Technical Focus:
- Malware ML benchmarking and reproducibility
- Temporal splits and concept drift evaluation
- Evasive malware / initially-undetected “challenge” evaluation set
- Static feature engineering (EMBER feature format v3)
- VirusTotal-based labeling and rescanning strategy
- Near-duplicate removal using TLSH

Use Cases:
- Benchmarking static malware detectors across multiple file formats (PE, APK, ELF, PDF)
- Measuring robustness to concept drift with time-based train/test splits
- Testing detection performance on evasive malware that bypasses initial AV/ML signals
- Training and evaluating malware family classifiers at scale (ClarAVy-derived labels)
- Research on multi-label prediction (behaviors, packers, exploited vulnerabilities, threat groups)
