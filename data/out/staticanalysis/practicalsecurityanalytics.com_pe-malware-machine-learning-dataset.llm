Title:
PE Malware Machine Learning Dataset

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This page publishes a downloadable dataset of raw, labeled Windows Portable Executable (PE) files intended for malware/benign classification research.  
- It addresses a common limitation of public ML datasets that only provide pre-extracted features/metadata rather than the original binaries, enabling researchers to engineer their own static features directly from PE structure and bytes.  
- The dataset includes 201,549 samples (≈114k malicious, ≈86k legitimate) with labels and hashes in a `samples.csv`, and the binaries stored by ID with extensions removed to reduce accidental execution risk.  
- Metadata fields include AV detection counts (total/positives), whitelist/blacklist label, file size, and Shannon entropy, plus MD5/SHA1/SHA256.  
- It documents sources for malicious samples (VirusShare, MalShare, theZoo) and discusses biases (family imbalance, Windows-heavy benign set, potential false positives).  
- Useful primarily for security/AI researchers and defenders building static malware detectors, and for red team/malware analysts needing a large corpus for feature exploration and tooling validation.

Technical Focus:
- Portable Executable (PE) static analysis and feature extraction
- Malware/benign labeling using AV consensus (positives/total)
- Dataset construction, curation, and bias considerations
- Hash-based sample tracking (MD5/SHA1/SHA256)
- Shannon entropy as a static indicator
- Safe handling of live malware samples (encrypted archive, no extensions)

Use Cases:
- Train/evaluate ML models for static PE malware detection
- Benchmark custom feature extractors (headers, sections, imports, byte n-grams, entropy, etc.)
- Build reproducible experiments using provided hashes and labels
- Study dataset bias/imbalance effects and improve sampling strategies
- Validate YARA/static triage heuristics against a large corpus
