Title:
Bluffy – Masking Shellcode in Realistic Datatypes (UUID/SVG/CSS/CSV) to Evade Static Detection

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post introduces “Bluffy,” a proof-of-concept tool that converts raw shellcode into benign-looking data formats to degrade static AV signatures without using encryption or compression.  
- It focuses on hiding bytes inside realistic datatypes such as UUID strings (decoded via `UuidFromStringA`) and structured text formats like SVG/XML and CSS (bytes embedded as integers in attributes/RGB values), plus CSV.  
- The UUID approach is highlighted as especially convenient because the Windows API writes decoded bytes directly into allocated memory, requiring only `VirtualAlloc` and a later `VirtualProtect` to execute.  
- SVG and CSS variants rely on parsing/extracting integer fields (implemented with regex using PCRE2) to reconstruct the payload into a byte array.  
- The author reports consistent bypass of Windows Defender static detection for these masks, with mixed runtime detection results (not the primary focus).  
- Useful for red teamers and malware developers exploring low-entropy, “looks-like-data” payload staging and signature evasion tradeoffs.

Technical Focus:
- Shellcode masking in common datatypes (UUID, SVG/XML, CSS, CSV)
- Windows API decoding primitives (`UuidFromStringA`, mention of `CLSIDFromString`)
- In-memory payload staging (`VirtualAlloc`, `VirtualProtect`, RW→RX transition)
- Regex-based payload reconstruction (PCRE2)
- Static vs dynamic detection behavior (Windows Defender)

Use Cases:
- Generating “benign-looking” payload containers for static signature evasion testing
- Building loaders that decode UUID-encoded shellcode into executable memory
- Embedding payload bytes into application-layer artifacts (SVG/CSS/CSV) for staging
- Evaluating AV/EDR static heuristics against low-entropy, non-encrypted encodings
- Creating alternative payload delivery formats for phishing or file-based initial access simulations
