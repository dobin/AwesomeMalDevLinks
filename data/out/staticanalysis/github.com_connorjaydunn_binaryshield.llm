Title:
BinaryShield — Bin-to-bin x86-64 Code Virtualizer

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- BinaryShield is an open-source x86-64 “code virtualization” protector that rewrites selected native instructions into a custom bytecode executed by an embedded virtual machine (VM).  
- It targets reverse-engineering resistance by replacing straightforward disassembly/decompilation with VM-based interpretation and a large set of VM handlers (60+).  
- The project focuses on a stack-based, RISC-like VM design, supports a wide range of x86-64 opcodes, and is designed to be multi-thread safe with multiple VM handler instances.  
- It uses Zydis for x86-64 decoding and takes a target binary plus an RVA range to virtualize (currently function/range-based).  
- Planned features include bytecode encryption, VM handler mutation, integrity checks, anti-debugging, randomized VM context, and more flexible region virtualization.  
- Useful primarily for malware developers, red team tool authors, and reverse engineers studying VM-based obfuscation/protection techniques.

Technical Focus:
- x86-64 instruction lifting and translation to custom bytecode
- VM-based obfuscation / code virtualization (handler-based interpreter)
- Binary rewriting (bin-to-bin transformation) using RVA ranges
- Stack-based RISC VM design and VM handler architecture
- Multi-thread safety and multiple handler instance strategies
- Disassembly/decoding with Zydis

Use Cases:
- Protecting sensitive routines in a native x64 binary against static analysis
- Researching and prototyping VM-based obfuscation/protection schemes
- Generating samples to evaluate devirtualization and RE workflows
- Studying handler design, opcode coverage, and VM context management in protectors
