Title:
garble — Obfuscate Go builds

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Garble is a Go build wrapper that obfuscates Go binaries while preserving runtime behavior, aiming to minimize recoverable source-level information.  
- It addresses the problem that Go binaries often retain package paths, identifiers, filenames/line info, and build/module metadata even when stripped, which aids reverse engineering.  
- The tool hooks into the Go toolchain (compiler/linker) to hash/rename identifiers and package paths, obfuscate or remove position info, strip symbols/debug info, and optionally obfuscate literals and apply “tiny” mode to remove additional runtime panic/trace output.  
- It supports deterministic/reproducible builds and provides `garble reverse` to de-obfuscate stack traces when you have the original source/seed (except in `-tiny` mode).  
- Useful for red teams, malware analysts/devs, and commercial Go developers distributing binaries or obfuscated source, and for defenders evaluating how obfuscation impacts static analysis and detections.  
- Interesting because it integrates with Go modules/build cache, handles reflection-related edge cases (including runtime patching), and documents limitations like reversibility of literal obfuscation and plugin incompatibility.

Technical Focus:
- Go toolchain wrapping (cmd/go, compiler, linker) and build-cache compatibility  
- Identifier/package path/filename/position obfuscation via hashed renaming  
- Symbol/debug/build-info stripping (`-ldflags="-w -s"`, removing module/build metadata)  
- Literal obfuscation (`-literals`) and its reversibility considerations  
- “Tiny” mode runtime/trace removal and binary size reduction  
- Deterministic obfuscation with seeds (`-seed`, `-seed=random`) and reverse mapping (`garble reverse`)

Use Cases:
- Obfuscate Go payloads/tools before delivery to reduce static RE value
- Ship commercial Go binaries with reduced source/structure leakage
- Distribute “obfuscated source” for private Go libraries where binary-only import isn’t possible
- Reduce Go binary size and embedded metadata with `-tiny`
- Test how EDR/AV and reverse-engineering workflows handle obfuscated Go binaries
- De-obfuscate panic stack traces from field deployments using `garble reverse` (when seed/source available)
