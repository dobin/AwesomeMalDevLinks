Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
Obfusk8 is a header-only C++17 library for obfuscating Windows binaries using a mix of compile-time and runtime transformations to hinder reverse engineering and static detection. It wraps the program entrypoint via a `_main` macro that injects a VM-like prologue/epilogue, indirect control-flow flattening, bogus control-flow graphs, junk code, and anti-analysis behaviors (including SEH-based exception paths). It provides compile-time string encryption (AES-like) with per-string keys and JIT stack decryption to reduce plaintext string exposure. For stealthy API usage, it resolves WinAPI functions dynamically by parsing the PEB and using compile-time hashed names to avoid obvious IAT/string artifacts. It also includes an indirect syscall engine that deduces SSNs by sorting Zw exports and executes syscalls via an in-ntdll `syscall; ret` gadget to avoid embedding `0F 05` and to preserve “clean” call stacks. This is primarily useful for red team tooling, malware development, and defenders/researchers studying modern obfuscation and syscall-evasion patterns.

Technical Focus:
- Entry-point wrapping with VM-style execution and state-machine control-flow flattening
- Bogus control flow, opaque predicates, and junk code injection
- Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic (MBA) expression obfuscation
- Compile-time string encryption with runtime/stack decryption
- PEB-walking API resolution with compile-time hashing (IAT minimization)
- Indirect syscalls: SSN deduction via export sorting + syscall gadget/thunking

Use Cases:
- Obfuscate sensitive logic in Windows implants/loaders/tools (selectively via method macros)
- Hide strings, DLL/API names, and reduce static import artifacts in PE files
- Execute Windows syscalls while bypassing user-mode hooks and avoiding direct syscall bytes
- Generate “analysis-hostile” control-flow for RE/triage resistance (IDA/decompiler friction)
- Research/detection engineering: build samples to test heuristic/behavioral detections
