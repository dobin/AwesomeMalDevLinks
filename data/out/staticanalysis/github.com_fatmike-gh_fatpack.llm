Title:
Fatpack — Windows x64 PE packer with LZMA compression and full TLS support

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Fatpack is a Windows x64 PE packer that compresses an input EXE with LZMA and wraps it in a loader stub that manually maps and executes the original image at runtime.  
- It targets native console and GUI executables (no .NET) and emphasizes correctness by supporting relocations, imports/delay-imports, exception handlers, proper section protections, and full TLS (callbacks + TLS data).  
- The packed payload can be embedded either as a resource (default) or appended as a custom section (`.fpack`, experimental), with the section mode aiming to avoid extra runtime allocations by fitting the unpacked image into a resized/renamed section.  
- The packer also extracts and re-embeds the target’s icon and manifest to preserve appearance and dependency/version requirements.  
- It is useful for red teams, malware developers, and reverse engineers who need a practical PE packing + in-memory loading implementation, and for defenders/researchers analyzing modern packer/loader behaviors beyond basic UPX.  

Technical Focus:
- PE manual mapping / custom PE loader stubs
- LZMA compression/decompression in loaders
- TLS support (TLS directory, callbacks, TLS data)
- Relocations, imports, delay imports resolution
- SEH / exception handling registration for mapped images
- Resource vs section-based payload embedding; rebasing and image base conflicts

Use Cases:
- Packing x64 Windows payloads while preserving TLS-heavy runtimes (e.g., Rust/Delphi)
- Building and testing custom manual-mapping loaders for research
- Creating packed binaries for AV/EDR evaluation (controlled lab use)
- Reverse-engineering practice on non-trivial packer stubs (TLS/SEH/import edge cases)
- Comparing compression/compatibility tradeoffs versus UPX on real-world binaries
