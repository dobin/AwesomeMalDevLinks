Title:
Alcatraz (x64 Binary Obfuscator)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Alcatraz is a Windows x64 PE binary obfuscator targeting `.exe`, `.dll`, and `.sys` files.  
- It rewrites selected functions to increase reverse-engineering cost by transforming constants, control flow, and instruction sequences while preserving semantics.  
- The repo showcases multiple obfuscation passes including control-flow flattening, arithmetic/instruction mutation, LEA-based reference hiding, and anti-disassembly byte tricks that disrupt linear sweep disassemblers and decompilers (e.g., IDA).  
- It also includes an entry-point obfuscation option for executables that decrypts the real entry point at runtime (with a noted limitation for manual-mapped scenarios).  
- Useful for red teams, malware developers, and tool authors who need to harden payloads against static analysis; also useful for blue teams/reversers to study common obfuscation patterns and build detections/deobfuscation workflows.  

Technical Focus:
- PE (Portable Executable) rewriting and function-level obfuscation
- Control Flow Flattening (CFG restructuring into dispatcher/blocks)
- Instruction mutation (e.g., ADD substitution sequences)
- Constant/immediate obfuscation via bitwise/arithmetic transforms
- Anti-disassembly techniques (byte-level tricks, misleading control flow)
- Entry-point transformation/decryption stubs

Use Cases:
- Obfuscate post-exploitation tooling or loaders to resist static analysis
- Increase decompiler friction for specific high-value functions
- Generate samples to test reverse-engineering pipelines and deobfuscators
- Research/education on practical x64 obfuscation and anti-disassembly patterns
- Prototype obfuscation passes for custom packers/protectors
