Title:
Exciting Journey Towards Import Address Table (IAT) of an Executable

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post explains how the Windows loader resolves imports in a PE (Portable Executable) and populates the Import Address Table (IAT) at load time.  
- It walks through the PE Optional Header’s DataDirectory, focusing on `IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT` and how it points to the Import Directory (`IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR` array) per imported DLL.  
- The article clarifies the relationship between `OriginalFirstThunk` (Import Lookup Table / Import Name Table) and `FirstThunk` (IAT), and how on-disk thunk data is overwritten in-memory with resolved function addresses.  
- It details `IMAGE_THUNK_DATA` and `IMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME`, including how to distinguish ordinal vs name imports via the high bit.  
- The content is primarily useful for malware analysts, reverse engineers, and exploit devs who need to parse PE imports, understand loader behavior, or recognize/implement IAT-based tampering.  
- It highlights why IAT visibility matters for capability triage and notes IAT hooking as a common runtime interception technique.

Technical Focus:
- PE Optional Header DataDirectory and `IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT`
- `IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR` (Name, OriginalFirstThunk, FirstThunk)
- Import Lookup Table (ILT/INT) vs Import Address Table (IAT)
- `IMAGE_THUNK_DATA` and ordinal vs name import resolution
- `IMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME` (Hint/Name) and loader patching of IAT
- IAT hooking concept (runtime API interception)

Use Cases:
- Rapid capability assessment of binaries by enumerating imported APIs/DLLs
- Writing PE parsers to extract Import Directory / IAT / ILT structures
- Debugging loader import resolution issues and malformed import tables
- Detecting packing/obfuscation indicators via sparse or unusual imports
- Implementing or hunting IAT hooking in malware/injection scenarios
