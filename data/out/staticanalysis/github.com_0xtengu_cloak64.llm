Title:
CLOAK64 — Metamorphic Decoder-Stub Generator (x86_64 Windows)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- CLOAK64 is an x86_64 Windows metamorphic code engine that generates unique, functionally equivalent decoder stubs for encrypted payloads.  
- It aims to reduce static signature reliability by varying instruction sequences, registers, pointer-advance patterns, junk code, and jump encodings while preserving semantics.  
- The tool derives per-build keys using RDTSC-seeded entropy mixed with Fibonacci-based key generation, then encrypts the payload with an inverse pair to the selected decode algorithm (e.g., ADD↔SUB).  
- It emits a tiny 15–16 byte position-independent bootstrap (CALL/POP + LEA/ADD + JMP) with no API calls, followed by a decoder loop that decrypts in-place and returns into the payload.  
- Useful for red team operators, malware developers, and researchers studying polymorphism/metamorphism, shellcode packing, and signature evasion tradeoffs.  
- Interesting because it combines PIC bootstrap constraints, multiple decode algorithm forms (direct/load-op-store/extended), and systematic metamorphic transformations in a compact assembly-only implementation.

Technical Focus:
- Metamorphic code generation (semantic-preserving instruction variants)
- Polymorphic decoder stubs and rolling-key payload encryption
- Position-independent code (CALL/POP RIP discovery) on x64 Windows
- RDTSC-based entropy seeding and Fibonacci-derived key material
- Junk instruction injection and control-flow/jump-length adaptation
- Register allocation/avoidance strategies in decoder loops

Use Cases:
- Generate per-build unique decoder stubs for packed shellcode/payloads
- Experiment with static-signature resistance via metamorphism and junk code
- Study PIC bootstrap design constraints (15–16B loader) for x64 blobs
- Build test samples for defensive research (YARA robustness, unpacking, emulation)
- Prototype custom packers/cryptors for controlled red team simulations
