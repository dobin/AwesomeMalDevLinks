Title:
Early Cryo Bird Injections – APC-based DLL & Shellcode Injection via Pre-Frozen Job Objects

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository provides C++ proof-of-concepts for “Early Cryo Bird” process injection, combining APC-based execution with creating a target process inside a pre-frozen Windows Job Object.  
- It aims to reduce common EDR visibility compared to classic Early Bird techniques that rely on `CREATE_SUSPENDED`/`DEBUG_PROCESS` process-creation flags.  
- The technique uses `NtSetInformationJobObject` with `JOBOBJECT_FREEZE_INFORMATION` to freeze/thaw execution, performs remote memory allocation/writes while the process is frozen, then queues an APC (`NtQueueApcThread`) to run either `LoadLibraryW` (DLL injection) or injected shellcode after thawing.  
- The write-up discusses APC requirements (alertable state) and contrasts “frozen” vs “suspended” process behavior.  
- It includes an EDR evaluation: Defender ATP and Trend Vision One showed no detections in the author’s tests, while Cortex XDR detected/blocked the shellcode variant more reliably and sometimes flagged the DLL variant.  
- Useful for red teamers and malware researchers exploring Windows-native injection tradecraft and for blue teamers validating detections around job-object freeze/thaw and APC queuing.

Technical Focus:
- Windows Job Objects freeze/thaw via `NtSetInformationJobObject` and `JOBOBJECT_FREEZE_INFORMATION`
- APC-based injection (`QueueUserAPC` / `NtQueueApcThread`, alertable execution)
- Process creation with `STARTUPINFOEXW` + `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_LIST` (job assignment at creation)
- Remote memory operations (`NtAllocateVirtualMemoryEx`, `NtWriteVirtualMemory`, protection changes RW→RX)
- DLL injection via `LoadLibraryW` APC vs shellcode APC execution
- EDR behavioral/detection considerations (RW→RX transitions, YARA/behavior rules)

Use Cases:
- Build and test stealthier Early Bird-style injection that avoids `CREATE_SUSPENDED`
- Compare detection surface of DLL-path APC injection vs shellcode APC injection
- Research Windows job-object internals and undocumented freeze controls
- Create lab detections for job freeze/thaw + APC queuing + remote memory writes
- Validate EDR telemetry/coverage for native NT API usage and memory-protection transitions
