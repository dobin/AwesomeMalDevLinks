&nbsp;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.arashparsa.com/content/images/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-22-at-11.24.18-PM.png" class="kg-image js-zoomable medium-zoom-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1426" height="160"></figure><p>Without doing a full demo this is a program that gets its own address base, based on its MAIN function and changes most of its memory section to RW. &nbsp;We will see a crash when it's complete. &nbsp;We will sleep a bit, do the protection, then we should see a crash. &nbsp;I will observe the crash using Process Hacker:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.arashparsa.com/content/images/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-21-at-7.32.54-PM.png" class="kg-image js-zoomable medium-zoom-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1842" height="510"></figure><p>As we can see it is wcx and we are stopped at the virtual protect, let's run the virtualprotect:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.arashparsa.com/content/images/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-21-at-7.36.52-PM.png" class="kg-image js-zoomable medium-zoom-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="378"></figure><p>If we look here we make most of our code rw (not even all of it) during execution before the program crashes with an exception and an access violation error before we can even touch the sleep. &nbsp;This really emphasizes a program cannot change it's own protections while it is running itself, this needs to be offloaded somehow, this is why we look towards Gargoyle.</p><p>Gargoyle offloads the VirtualProtect work to an Asynchronous Procedure Call, otherwise known as an APC. &nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sync/asynchronous-procedure-calls?ref=arashparsa.com">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sync/asynchronous-procedure-calls</a>. &nbsp;In short, APCs are basically code that can be lined, or queued, up passively within a thread as the thread does work. &nbsp;When the thread is sent into an alertable state using a function such as SleepEx with a value of TRUE <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-sleepex?ref=arashparsa.com">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-sleepex</a>, the next queued code that passively existed in the thread executes. &nbsp;As the queued code runs we can consider our main code "dormant", effectively offloading the work to windows itself to remove the RX or RWX flag for us. &nbsp;</p><p>Since Gargoyle already has a pretty thorough blogpost documenting the technique and the idea behind it (<a href="https://lospi.net/security/assembly/c/cpp/developing/software/2017/03/04/gargoyle-memory-analysis-evasion.html?ref=arashparsa.com">https://lospi.net/security/assembly/c/cpp/developing/software/2017/03/04/gargoyle-memory-analysis-evasion.html</a>) I will instead focus on the x64 port to allow us to run x64 payloads as well. &nbsp;The initial gargoyle flow needs to be such that a ropchain is created that first calls virtualprotect to change our protection, then calls sleep with the user provided time of course, and finally changes back to RX before handing back execution to allow our code to run when waking up for tasking.</p><p>In order to perform the ropchain I decided to make a DLL dropper that could be converted to shellcode with sRDI (<a href="https://github.com/monoxgas/sRDI?ref=arashparsa.com">https://github.com/monoxgas/sRDI</a>). &nbsp;The idea is our DLL would drop the malicious cobalt strike shellcode in memory and would contain the ropchain and APC logic required to RW the cobalt strike beacon. &nbsp;As the DLL will be converted to shellcode with sRDI and injected as well we will actually end up with 3 new RWX allocations, 1 for the cobalt strike shellcode, 1 for the injected sRDI dll, and 1 for the sRDI shellcode that offloads the DLL that it wraps. &nbsp;We will need to free the sRDI shellcode allocation when its offload is complete to reduce one RWX ioc but we will also additionally need to gargoyle our relfectively loaded DLL shellcode that contains our new logic as well! &nbsp;Let's see what the 3 allocations looks like:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.arashparsa.com/content/images/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-21-at-7.56.21-PM.png" class="kg-image js-zoomable medium-zoom-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1012" height="626"></figure><p>We can see here we have 2 RWX (our dll and cobalt strike) and 1 RX (the sRDI offload shellcode). &nbsp;With the new logic, this means our new flow essentially needs to self free the sRDI allocation while the ropchain needs to VP Cobalt Strike -&gt; VP DLL -&gt; Sleep -&gt; VP DLL -&gt; VP Cobalt Strike -&gt; Return. &nbsp;</p><p>First, I decided to start off with the freeing of the sRDI code. &nbsp;It has to be automatically freed of course or we're cheating. &nbsp;To accomplish this I took a peek into the source code to identify how user data was passed...</p><pre><code>				exportFunc(lpUserData, nUserdataLen);
</code></pre><p><a href="https://github.com/monoxgas/sRDI/blob/5690685aee6751d0dbcf2c50b6fdd4427c1c9a0a/ShellcodeRDI/ShellcodeRDI.c?ref=arashparsa.com#L580">https://github.com/monoxgas/sRDI/blob/5690685aee6751d0dbcf2c50b6fdd4427c1c9a0a/ShellcodeRDI/ShellcodeRDI.c#L580</a></p><p>We can see here when an export function is passed to this wrapper it passes the user data and size of the data here as arguments to the user specified function. &nbsp;This basically means if we were to use the sRDI libs to generate a payload using python such as:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><pre>	<code>
    python3 ConvertToShellcode.py -f main Lockd.dll -u test
    </code>
</pre><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Then you actually pass the argument "test" as the first argument to your main function with the value 4 (size of test) as the second. &nbsp;It's a neat feature for monoxgas to give us. &nbsp;Instead though, let's go ahead and make it so the sRDI code can pass its base as an argument instead, this will let the DLL it is offloading know where it exists to just go ahead and free the sRDI shellcode when it's finished offloading.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><pre>	<code>
    exportFunc((LPVOID)LoadDLL, (DWORD)sizeof(LPVOID));
    </code>
</pre><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The second argument is a dummy size as I didn't want to handle the virtualquerying as PIC code within the sRDI. &nbsp;We will be calculating the size within the DLL using virtualquery once we obtain the location of the LoadDLL function (passed from the sRDI shellcode) as an argument. &nbsp;</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><pre>	<code>
    __declspec(dllexport) void main(LPVOID dllOffloadEntry = NULL)
    </code>
</pre><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This allows main to accept the address of the function as an argument optionally, as we may not always need it and provide it as a result.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><pre>	<code>
	if (dllOffloadEntry != NULL) {
		MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION cleanOffloader = { 0 };
		//PSIZE_T w = 0;
		//_VirtualQuery(GetCurrentProcess(), (PVOID)dllOffloadEntry, MemoryBasicInformation, &amp;cleanOffloader, sizeof(cleanOffloader), w);
		VirtualQuery(dllOffloadEntry, &amp;cleanOffloader, sizeof(cleanOffloader));
		CreateThread(NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)doCleanup, (LPVOID)cleanOffloader.AllocationBase, 0, NULL);
	}    </code>
</pre><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><pre>	<code>
    void doCleanup(LPVOID cleanup) {
	SleepEx(500, FALSE);
	VirtualFree(cleanup, 0, MEM_RELEASE);
}
	</code>
</pre><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Here we offload it using a thread that calls a cleanup function that performs the free after a certain time (to ensure the sRDI is completely done), this is non optimal and there are much better ways to sync this such as using NtWaitForSingleObject, &nbsp;though for our purposes this certainly works.</p><p>With this we recompile our sRDI which should output an exe that will contain a PIC .text section we now need to extract, I used <a href="https://github.com/y11en/FOLIAGE/blob/master/scripts/pedump.py?ref=arashparsa.com">https://github.com/y11en/FOLIAGE/blob/master/scripts/pedump.py</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/ilove2pwn_?ref=arashparsa.com">https://twitter.com/ilove2pwn</a> to accomplish this. &nbsp;With the implemented updates we get the new sRDI convertoshellcode script you can find here: <a href="https://github.com/waldo-irc/YouMayPasser/blob/master/ShellcodeRDI.py?ref=arashparsa.com">https://github.com/waldo-irc/YouMayPasser/blob/master/ShellcodeRDI.py</a>. &nbsp;From now on, if we generate a shellcode dll and pass a function as an entry point as a supplied argument to the python shellcode generator, then that function will get the location of the LoadDLL function in the sRDI code as an argument for freeing. &nbsp;Our injected DLL will now also free the RX section a second after being offloaded, leaving us with only 2 RWX sections left to resolve.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.arashparsa.com/content/images/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-21-at-8.18.59-PM.png" class="kg-image js-zoomable medium-zoom-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1109"></figure><p>To fix this we must now begin work on our Gargoyle ropchain. &nbsp;Again, since Gargoyle is already blogged about and well documented with an x86 POC we will only be covering the differences in x64 for the conversion.</p><p>The first difference we will need to observe is how arguments are lined up in assembly for x86 vs x64. &nbsp;In x86 the arguments are lined up on the stack and when you return or call the function it will go down the stack to pull each argument, this is reflected in &nbsp;Gargoyles ASM here: <a href="https://github.com/JLospinoso/gargoyle/blob/master/setup.nasm?ref=arashparsa.com">https://github.com/JLospinoso/gargoyle/blob/master/setup.nasm</a>. &nbsp;The x64 calling convention only puts SOME arguments on the stack and way further down the stack at that. &nbsp;The x64 calling convention for Windows is described at length here: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/x64-calling-convention?view=msvc-170&amp;ref=arashparsa.com">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/x64-calling-convention?view=msvc-170</a>.</p><p>In short, the first 4 arguments get lined up into RCX first, followed by RDX, R8 and finally R9. &nbsp;Subsequent arguments get pulled from the stack starting with RSP+0x20, but when we enter a function the return address gets pushed to the top of the stack subsequently actually making the first value located at RSP+0x28. &nbsp;After that, each argument is right after the next, RSP+0x30, RSP+0x38 etc. &nbsp;This is important because as we line up our functions in our ropchain we need to make sure we put the correct arguments in the correct location. &nbsp;Let's see how this works with a MessageBoxA that takes 4 args...</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.arashparsa.com/content/images/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-22-at-10.21.56-PM.png" class="kg-image js-zoomable medium-zoom-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="594" height="70"></figure><p>We run the function, set a break, and then step into it...</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.arashparsa.com/content/images/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-22-at-10.22.07-PM.png" class="kg-image js-zoomable medium-zoom-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1128" height="210"></figure><p> &nbsp;Knowing what 4 registers contain our arguments, we can actually already see it being prepared before the function call is made. &nbsp;R9 and ecx, the 2 NULL arguments, are both being xor'd and zeroed out, which matches what we had in our function. &nbsp;It's important to note here we see xor ECX with ECX. &nbsp;In an x64 machine, this only 0's out the lower 32 bits of the register but in this case the upper 32 bits were already 0'ed out so presumably the compiler decided to optimize it this way. &nbsp;Generally, you'd have to xor RCX with RCX to completely empty that register in x64. &nbsp;RDX and R8 each contain a string we can see in the stack:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.arashparsa.com/content/images/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-22-at-10.22.33-PM.png" class="kg-image js-zoomable medium-zoom-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1796" height="314"></figure><p>The first address contains our "Test" string argument which is what R8 contains and is our third argument, and the second contains our "Title" string argument which is what RDX contains and is our second argument passed to the function, basically validating the x64 calling convention. &nbsp;This shows how functions work in assembly up to the first 4 arguments at least, the rest (arguments 5 and up) should be easy to identify at this point too if needed by looking to the stack.</p><p>Knowing all this, our next step was trying to see if we could hit the lottery and find a REALLY simple ropgadget that can just line up all the args at once for us if we're lucky in order make the ropchain very easy. &nbsp;I used the following code to find gadgets:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><pre>	<code>

	{

		{
			char szModName[MAX_PATH];

			LPBYTE moduleMath = (LPBYTE)hMods[i];
