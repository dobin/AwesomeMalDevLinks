Title:
In-Memory Evasion (Cobalt Strike mini-course)

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post introduces a multi-part video mini-course on evading in-memory detection heuristics used to identify injected code/DLLs by inspecting process, thread, and memory artifacts.  
- It frames the “cat and mouse” between modern EDR/analyst memory triage and common offensive tradecraft, using Cobalt Strike Beacon as a representative payload.  
- Part 1 covers what defenders can observe (via tools like Process Hacker) and the common heuristics used to flag suspicious memory regions, threads, and module mappings.  
- Part 2 walks through a payload’s lifecycle and highlights where typical offense frameworks deviate from normal program behavior—and which deviations are optional.  
- Part 3 focuses on practical evasion guidance, including configuring how Beacon lives in memory and performing an OPSEC review of configuration choices, with emphasis on how process context affects detection tolerance.  
- Part 4 (and a 3.11 addendum) discusses threat emulation, showing how memory/evasion configuration can be tuned to resemble specific actor tradecraft for simulation and analyst conditioning.  

Technical Focus:
- Windows process/thread/memory inspection artifacts and heuristics
- In-memory injection indicators (RWX pages, suspicious allocations, anomalous threads)
- Payload lifecycle mapping to detection points (allocation, staging, execution)
- Cobalt Strike Beacon in-memory configuration and OPSEC review
- Process context selection and its impact on EDR heuristics
- Threat emulation via configurable in-memory behaviors

Use Cases:
- Red team tuning of in-memory payload behavior to reduce heuristic detections
- Blue team understanding of common in-memory evasion patterns and where to instrument detections
- Pre-engagement OPSEC reviews of Cobalt Strike Beacon configuration
- Building realistic threat emulation profiles for purple team exercises
- Analyst training on memory triage and distinguishing benign vs. suspicious memory artifacts
