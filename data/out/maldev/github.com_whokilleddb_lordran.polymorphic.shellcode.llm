Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository is a small PoC demonstrating “polymorphic”/self-modifying shellcode behavior on Windows.  
- It generates/executes shellcode that performs normal execution, then overwrites the previously executed stub to hinder post-execution forensic recovery, and reuses the same memory region to run a second-stage shellcode blob.  
- The demo shows two stages via MessageBox popups (“Bonfire” then “Hello World”), illustrating staged execution and in-place code replacement.  
- Implementation details include controlling function placement in the PE `.text` section using GCC attributes (mingw) and handling data placement issues (avoiding `.rdata` for the shellcode buffer).  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers, exploit devs, and malware researchers exploring self-overwriting stubs, staged payload execution, and memory reuse tradeoffs.  
- The author notes it is not OPSEC-safe and is intended as a weekend PoC rather than production-grade tradecraft.

Technical Focus:
- Self-modifying / self-overwriting shellcode stubs
- In-memory staged payload execution and memory region reuse
- PE section layout control (`.text` placement) with GCC `__attribute__((section))`
- Windows shellcode execution patterns (RWX/RX memory, function-pointer execution)
- mingw toolchain quirks (`.rdata` vs `.text`/`.data`) and shellcode embedding
- Simple shellcode runner script (Python)

Use Cases:
- Prototype self-erasing shellcode stubs to reduce recoverable in-memory artifacts
- Experiment with multi-stage shellcode where stage-2 replaces stage-1 in-place
- Study PE layout/section placement effects on shellcode extraction and execution
- Build test cases for EDR/forensics detection of self-modifying code behaviors
