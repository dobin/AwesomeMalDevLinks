# Process Inject Kit

[Permalink: Process Inject Kit](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/process-inject-kit#process-inject-kit)

This is a port of Cobalt Strike's Process Inject Kit from C to the C++ BOF template.

## How it works

[Permalink: How it works](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/process-inject-kit#how-it-works)

The built in fork and run process injection techniques can be change with
the `PROCESS_INJECT_SPAWN` and `PROCESS_INJECT_EXPLICIT` hooks.

This repo provides the following:

- Source code implementing the built-in techniques.
- Aggressor script to implement the hooks.
- Visual Studio solution to compile and generate a distribution directory.

### PROCESS\_INJECT\_SPAWN

[Permalink: PROCESS_INJECT_SPAWN](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/process-inject-kit#process_inject_spawn)

Allow users to define how the `spawn` process injection technique is implemented.

### PROCESS\_INJECT\_EXPLICIT

[Permalink: PROCESS_INJECT_EXPLICIT](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/process-inject-kit#process_inject_explicit)

Allow users to define how the `explicit` process injection technique is implemented.

## Usage

[Permalink: Usage](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/process-inject-kit#usage)

To use the Process Inject Kit:

- Build the VS solution in Release mode, as both x64 and x86.
- Load `process-inject.cna` into Cobalt Strike.
