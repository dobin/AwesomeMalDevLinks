Title:
Microsoft Trusted Signing service abused to code-sign malware

Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
This article reports on threat actors abusing Microsoft’s cloud-based Trusted Signing service to code-sign malware with short-lived (3-day) certificates. The abuse helps malware appear more legitimate and can reduce friction with security controls that treat signed binaries with higher trust (e.g., SmartScreen reputation and user-mode trust). Samples observed were signed by a Microsoft-managed CA chain (e.g., “Microsoft ID Verified CS EOC CA 01”) and linked to active campaigns including Lumma Stealer and “Crazy Evil Traffers” crypto-theft activity. The piece highlights how Trusted Signing’s easier identity validation (especially for individuals) can be a more convenient alternative to obtaining/stolen EV code-signing certs, while still providing meaningful trust signals. Microsoft states it monitors for misuse and responds with certificate revocation and account suspension, but the window between issuance and revocation remains operationally useful for attackers. It’s most relevant to defenders and threat hunters tracking signed-malware tradecraft, and to red teams modeling trust-abuse paths in Windows execution chains.

Technical Focus:
- Code-signing trust chains and Authenticode validation
- Microsoft Trusted Signing (Azure) workflow and managed CA issuance
- Short-lived certificates vs. revocation realities
- SmartScreen reputation and trust signaling for signed binaries
- Malware campaign operationalization of legitimate signing services

Use Cases:
- Hunting for malware signed by Microsoft Trusted Signing-issued certificates (issuer/subject patterns, validity windows)
- Building detections around newly issued/rare signer identities and rapid certificate churn
- Assessing enterprise controls that over-trust signed executables (application control, EDR policies, SmartScreen)
- Incident response triage: prioritizing signed-but-new/low-reputation binaries and correlating with revocation events
