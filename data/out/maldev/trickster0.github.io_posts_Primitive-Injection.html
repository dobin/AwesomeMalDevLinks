I thought I would give a challenge to myself and achieve the above or, like I mentioned, other variations by only opening the remote process with PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD and PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION. If you have not understood yet where this is going, basically I wanted to create primitives or remotely allocating, reading and writing memory remotely by just creating threads.</p><p>There has been some previous research on this by Austin Hudson (He posted something on <del>twitter</del> X) and <a href="https://www.x86matthew.com/view_post?id=read_write_proc_memory">x86matthew</a> but I wanted something better.<br> I am sure most of you would think, let’s try to find a rop gadget and do this; so did I! However, it was not that easy since in order to avoid PROCESS_VM_OPERATION to patch CFG on processes was included in my challenge.<br> This means that I would have to find a rop gadget that would not be impacted by CFG and that it will be good for the job. Also I wanted to limit my rop gadgets to ntdll for personal reasons.<br> Remote allocation is easy enough if you do not care about its permissions in memory as long as it is writable; just open the remote process with PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION and PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD, and create a new thread by passing the malloc function with the size you want the allocation to have.</p><p>Malloc Definition:</p><div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="code-header" data-lang="plaintext"><button data-original-title="" title=""><i class="fa-fw far fa-clipboard"></i></button></div><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

Next step was stitching the Read primitive with the Allocation primitive to obtain the remotely allocated memory address.</p><p>Turns out there is a workaround and this is the reason PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION is required (or does it?). By calling NtQueryInformationProcess and asking for ProcessBasicInformation, it is possible to receive the remote process’ PEB address, which also contains the process base heap address.<br> Since malloc allocates in process’ base heap, my allocation should be based on that base heap, hence since I could obtain the last 4 bytes of the allocation address, I could perform an AND mask operation between them.<br> Steps for obtaining the remotely allocated address:<br> 1) Call NtQueryInformationProcess with ProcessBasicInformation to obtain the PEB address<br> 2) Calling the Read primitive on the previously obtained PEB address + 0x30 offset, and reading 8 bytes to get the heap base address off the GetExitCodeThread<br> 3) Perform the AND mask operation to calculate the actual allocation address:</p><div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="code-header" data-lang="plaintext"><button data-original-title="" title=""><i class="fa-fw far fa-clipboard"></i></button></div><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

However in a WriteProcessMemory situation, it would require to pass a memory to write the bytes and the bytes to write, so at least 2 arguments. NtQueueApcThread allows for up to 3 arguments, so I had to find a rop gadget to achieve that in the most optimal way.<br> Both of the public approaches used RtlFillMemory which fits with NtQueueApcThread but it would literally create 1 APC request per byte that you want to write, hence an average shellcode of 270kb would create 270.000 APCs.

However, in order to optimize the process in case the bytes are more or less than 8 or 16 or divisible by 8, I had to use RtlFillBuffer as well.</p><p>Wrapper created for this primitive for remote allocation:</p><div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="code-header" data-lang="plaintext"><button data-original-title="" title=""><i class="fa-fw far fa-clipboard"></i></button></div><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

It is really easy to perform an injection which I am not gonna go through here but in the proof of concept code on my <a href="https://github.com/trickster0/PrimitiveInjection">github link</a>, you will find a BOF example. I will be cheating there a little bit by using PROCESS_VM_OPERATION to patch CFG in the remote process in order to call NtContinue, since Foliage’s method of calling APIs in the remote process is very convenient and also write primitive solves the problem with passing more than four arguments with the CONTEXTS, like you will notice in my POC. FYI I leave this for the reader; it is possible to perform a very OPSEC injection with limited IOCs with just PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD permissions.</p><p>Aside from the above, it is worth mentioning that we completely remove the telemetry of ETWTI for ReadProcessMemory and WriteProcessMemory. Also we create threads and call APCs with addresses that are fully backed in memory to files on disk.</p><h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2><p>The only caveat I want to mention is that the read primitive, even though it works great for reading small size buffers, trying to abuse this to read many chunks will make the system unusable and almost frozen, since I tried to perform LSASS dumping with it and the amount of threads being created is just insane. It was working but after a bit it just froze, so realistically you cannot use it for LSASS dumping BUT you might be able to find a faster method to do it (wink wink).</p><h2 id="bonus">Bonus</h2><p>I hope you took note of the fact that I do not call ROP gadgets, they are literally functions, which has some positive side effects. Aside from the fact that these primitives are also useful in exploit developers, they also offer a partial CET bypass. Even though I am not an expert on the subject of CET, It offers a couple of protection mechanisms; Shadow stack and Indirect Branch Tracking (IBT).<br> IBT is a code integrity control flow mechanism that can easily kill rop gadgets but since in my case the primitives call literal function, it is an automatic bypass.</p><p>Another bonus which is an extreme case but could happen is, if you would ever find an elevated process that allows for a low/medium context process to open a handle with just PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD, you can perform a privilege escalation.</p><h2 id="final-notes">Final Notes</h2><p>Obviously these wrappers can be used for the local process as well but it kind of loses the point, since it is easier to write a custom memcpy to read/write bytes. Lastly, this is more about the primitives and the wrappers than the actual injection that is the result of them.</p></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> CC BY 4.0 </a> by the author.</div><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Primitive%20Injection%20-%20Breaking%20the%20Status%20Quo%20-%20trickster0%27s%20Nest&amp;url=https://trickster0.github.io/posts/Primitive-Injection/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Twitter" data-original-title="Twitter"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-twitter"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Primitive%20Injection%20-%20Breaking%20the%20Status%20Quo%20-%20trickster0%27s%20Nest&amp;u=https://trickster0.github.io/posts/Primitive-Injection/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Facebook" data-original-title="Facebook"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-facebook-square"></i> </a> <a href="https://telegram.me/share?text=Primitive%20Injection%20-%20Breaking%20the%20Status%20Quo%20-%20trickster0%27s%20Nest&amp;url=https://trickster0.github.io/posts/Primitive-Injection/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Telegram" data-original-title="Telegram"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-telegram"></i> </a> <i class="fa-fw fas fa-link small" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="Copy link"> </i> </span></div></div></div></div></div><div id="panel-wrapper" class="col-xl-3 pl-2 text-muted topbar-down"><div class="access"><div id="access-lastmod" class="post"> <span>Recent Update</span><ul class="post-content pl-0 pb-1 ml-1 mt-2"><li><a href="https://trickster0.github.io/posts/Primitive-Injection/">Primitive Injection - Breaking the Status Quo</a></li><li><a href="https://trickster0.github.io/posts/Custom-ReadMemory-API/">Custom ReadMemory API</a></li><li><a href="https://trickster0.github.io/posts/Halo's-Gate-Evolves-to-Tartarus-Gate/">Halo's Gate Evolves -&gt; Tartarus' Gate</a></li><li><a href="https://trickster0.github.io/posts/Solving-the-BFS-EkoParty/">Solving the BFS Ekoparty 2019 Exploitation Challenge</a></li><li><a href="https://trickster0.github.io/posts/earlybird-apc-queue-injection-with-processstatechange-a-twist/">EarlyBird APC Queue Injection With a ProcessStateChange Twist</a></li></ul></div><div id="access-tags"> <span>Trending Tags</span><div class="d-flex flex-wrap mt-3 mb-1 mr-3"> <a class="post-tag" href="https://trickster0.github.io/tags/hacking/">hacking</a> <a class="post-tag" href="https://trickster0.github.io/tags/vulnhub/">vulnhub</a> <a class="post-tag" href="https://trickster0.github.io/tags/vm/">vm</a> <a class="post-tag" href="https://trickster0.github.io/tags/challenge/">challenge</a> <a class="post-tag" href="https://trickster0.github.io/tags/challenges/">challenges</a> <a class="post-tag" href="https://trickster0.github.io/tags/hack/">hack</a> <a class="post-tag" href="https://trickster0.github.io/tags/0/">%0</a> <a class="post-tag" href="https://trickster0.github.io/tags/asa/">asa</a> <a class="post-tag" href="https://trickster0.github.io/tags/certificate/">certificate</a> <a class="post-tag" href="https://trickster0.github.io/tags/cisco/">cisco</a></div></div></div><div id="toc-wrapper" class="pl-0 pr-4 mb-5"> <span class="pl-3 pt-2 mb-2">Contents</span></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-lg-11 col-xl-8"><div id="post-extend-wrapper" class="pl-1 pr-1 pl-sm-2 pr-sm-2 pl-md-4 pr-md-4"><div id="related-posts" class="mt-5 mb-2 mb-sm-4"><h3 class="pt-2 mt-1 mb-4 ml-1" data-toc-skip="">Further Reading</h3><div class="card-deck mb-4"><div class="card"> <a href="https://trickster0.github.io/posts/Custom-ReadMemory-API/"><div class="card-body"> <span class="timeago small">Feb 13, 2022 <i class="unloaded">2022-02-13T00:00:00+08:00</i></span><h3 class="pt-0 mt-1 mb-3" data-toc-skip="">Custom ReadMemory API</h3><div class="text-muted small"><p> After the great job and inspiration by x86matthew and his blogpost I decided to play with it as well for x64 bit.
