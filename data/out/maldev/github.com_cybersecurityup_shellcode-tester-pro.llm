Title:
Shellcode Tester Pro

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Shellcode Tester Pro is a Python/PyQt5 GUI for analyzing, emulating, and reverse engineering shellcode samples.  
- It addresses the need to safely inspect shellcode behavior without executing it on a live system by using Unicorn Engine for CPU emulation and Capstone for disassembly.  
- The tool supports importing shellcode in multiple formats (escaped `\x`, raw hex, and binary files like `.bin/.exe/.elf`) and can extract shellcode from binaries.  
- It includes heuristic checks and fingerprinting to identify common payload/tooling origins (e.g., msfvenom, Cobalt Strike, Sliver, Empire), plus detection of NOP sleds, encryption, and obfuscation patterns.  
- It provides basic deobfuscation (notably XOR), memory dumping, and report export (PDF), and can run simulated execution in an external terminal.  
- A plugin system allows extending analysis and automation, making it useful for malware analysts, reverse engineers, and red teamers validating payloads.

Technical Focus:
- Shellcode emulation (Unicorn Engine)
- Disassembly and instruction analysis (Capstone)
- Shellcode extraction from PE/ELF/binary blobs
- Heuristic detection and tool fingerprinting (msfvenom/C2 frameworks)
- Obfuscation/encryption detection and XOR deobfuscation
- Extensible plugin architecture (Python)

Use Cases:
- Triage unknown shellcode safely via emulation and disassembly
- Identify likely shellcode generator/C2 framework from fingerprints
- Extract embedded shellcode from executables for deeper RE
- Detect and peel simple XOR-obfuscated payloads; dump decoded memory
- Generate quick analysis artifacts (disassembly/report) for case notes
- Extend analysis workflows with custom plugins (e.g., YARA-like checks, IOC extraction)
