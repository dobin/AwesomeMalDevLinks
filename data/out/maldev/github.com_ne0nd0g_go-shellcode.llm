Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- A Go-based collection of Windows shellcode runners plus utilities for transforming/encrypting shellcode blobs.  
- It demonstrates multiple local execution and remote injection techniques using a variety of Win32 and NT native/undocumented APIs, including thread creation, APC-based execution, and entrypoint patching in suspended processes.  
- Several implementations intentionally avoid `golang.org/x/sys/windows` by manually loading DLLs and resolving procedures, highlighting different tradeoffs in API usage and detection surface.  
- It includes “EarlyBird” APC injection (QueueUserAPC + ResumeThread/NtTestAlert), ETW-thread execution via `EtwpCreateEtwThread`, and “special user APC” via `NtQueueApcThreadEx`.  
- ShellcodeUtils supports base64 encoding and XOR/RC4/AES-256-GCM (Argon2id-derived key) encryption/decryption workflows for shellcode files.  
- Useful for red teamers, pentesters, and malware researchers to prototype loaders, compare injection primitives, and build test cases for EDR detections.

Technical Focus:
- Windows shellcode execution primitives (local vs remote)
- Process injection and suspended-process entrypoint patching (hollowing-like)
- APC injection (QueueUserAPC, NtQueueApcThreadEx, NtTestAlert)
- Native/undocumented NTDLL APIs (RtlCreateUserThread, EtwpCreateEtwThread)
- Manual DLL loading / dynamic API resolution in Go
- Shellcode encoding/encryption (XOR, RC4, AES-256-GCM, Argon2id)

Use Cases:
- Build and test different Windows shellcode loaders in Go
- Compare detection/telemetry differences across injection APIs (CreateRemoteThread vs APC vs native)
- Execute shellcode in a child process and capture stdout/stderr via anonymous pipes (e.g., Donut-loaded .NET assemblies)
- Generate encrypted/encoded shellcode payloads for staged loaders and lab simulations
- Create reproducible samples for blue team detection engineering and EDR evaluation
