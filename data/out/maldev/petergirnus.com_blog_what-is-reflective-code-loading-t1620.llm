Title:
Exploring Defense Evasion through Reflective Code Loading (T1620)

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post explains MITRE ATT&CK technique T1620 (Reflective Code Loading) and why it’s commonly used for defense evasion on Windows, especially for in-memory execution of .NET assemblies.  
- It highlights attacker motivations: avoiding disk artifacts, complicating static analysis via obfuscation/encryption, and enabling flexible payload delivery.  
- The core tutorial walks through compiling a simple C# executable, hosting it over HTTP, and using a VBScript “dropper” to launch PowerShell that downloads the binary and loads it directly into memory with `System.Reflection.Assembly::Load`.  
- It then uses reflection to locate the `Main` method and invoke it, demonstrating execution (spawning calc.exe) without traditional on-disk execution flow.  
- Useful for threat hunters and defenders to understand common in-memory tradecraft, and for red teamers/pentesters as a basic pattern for .NET in-memory loading.  
- Interesting because it shows an end-to-end, minimal chain (VBS → PowerShell → HTTP → .NET reflection) that maps cleanly to real-world intrusion behavior.

Technical Focus:
- MITRE ATT&CK T1620 Reflective Code Loading
- In-memory .NET assembly loading (`System.Reflection.Assembly.Load(byte[])`)
- PowerShell download cradle (`Invoke-WebRequest`) and execution
- Reflection-based method discovery/invocation (`GetType`, `GetMethod`, `MethodInfo.Invoke`)
- VBScript dropper execution via `WScript.Shell`
- HTTP payload hosting (Python `http.server`)

Use Cases:
- Simulate reflective loading tradecraft for detection engineering and purple teaming
- Build test cases for EDR telemetry around PowerShell + in-memory .NET execution
- Threat hunting for patterns of `Assembly.Load` and reflective invocation
- Demonstrate fileless execution chains for security training/labs
