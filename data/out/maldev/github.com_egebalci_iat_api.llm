Title:
IAT_API (Import Address Table API resolver/caller for shellcode)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository provides x86/x64 assembly “block” code that locates and calls Windows API functions by parsing the running module’s Import Address Table (IAT) rather than walking exports.  
- It resolves functions by iterating `_IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR` entries and matching a CRC32 hash of `(module name + function name)` against a caller-supplied value, then performs a direct `CALL` with provided arguments.  
- The approach is designed to evade certain exploit mitigations and detections that focus on Export Address Table (EAT) parsing (e.g., EMET EAF/EAF+) and “caller checks,” since it avoids reading KERNEL32/NTDLL exports and calls the resolved pointer directly.  
- It includes a Python helper to compute the CRC32 hashes and example MessageBox shellcode for both 32-bit and 64-bit.  
- It’s primarily useful for shellcode authors, exploit developers, and red team/malware tradecraft research where API resolution needs to be compact and mitigation-aware.  
- A key constraint is that the target API must already be imported by the host PE, otherwise resolution fails/crashes.

Technical Focus:
- PE import parsing (`_IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR`, Import Table/IAT walking)
- API hashing (CRC32 with polynomial 0x11EDC6F41; configurable rotation to avoid ROR13 signatures)
- Shellcode-style position-independent assembly (x86/x64)
- EMET mitigation bypass concepts (EAF/EAF+, caller checks)
- Indirect API invocation via IAT function pointers

Use Cases:
- Building shellcode that resolves APIs without EAT traversal
- Researching/evading EAF/EAF+ style export-filtering mitigations
- Creating hash-based API lookup schemes for payloads/loaders
- Developing PoCs that must operate under exploit-mitigation constraints
- Comparing IAT-based vs EAT-based API resolution tradeoffs in detection engineering
