Title:
Windows x64 shellcode to load DLL from memory (win-shellcode-dev)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository provides a Windows x64 reflective DLL loader implemented as position-independent x64 assembly shellcode that loads a DLL directly from memory (no on-disk DLL required).  
- It demonstrates the minimal PE-loading steps needed to map an in-memory DLL: resolve required kernel exports, allocate/copy sections, fix imports, apply relocations, and call the DLL entry point.  
- The approach is explicitly based on Stephen Fewer’s ReflectiveDLLInjection methodology, adapted into standalone shellcode.  
- A Python script builds a combined payload (shellcode + embedded target.dll) into a single `shellcode.bin`, and a simple `loader.exe` executes it for testing.  
- Useful for red teamers, exploit developers, and malware researchers studying reflective loading mechanics and custom in-memory module mapping.  
- Interesting because it’s a compact, educational reference implementation of manual PE loading logic in shellcode form.

Technical Focus:
- Reflective DLL injection / in-memory PE loading
- Kernel32 export parsing and API resolution
- Manual mapping: section copying, import resolution, relocation processing
- Position-independent x64 assembly shellcode
- Payload building/packing (shellcode + DLL) via Python
- DLL entry point invocation (DllMain)

Use Cases:
- Build and test custom reflective loaders for implants
- Study PE format loading steps for offensive tooling or research
- Prototype in-memory execution techniques without dropping DLLs to disk
- Create a minimal lab PoC for manual mapping and import/reloc handling
