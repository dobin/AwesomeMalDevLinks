Title:
RedirectThread (CONTEXT-Only Attack Surface / Execution-Only Process Injection)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- RedirectThread is a Windows C++ research toolset exploring “execution-only” remote code execution primitives centered around manipulating a thread’s `CONTEXT` rather than the classic allocate→write→execute injection flow.  
- It demonstrates ways to trigger code execution in a remote process while minimizing or avoiding remote memory allocation and writes, including DLL loading via `LoadLibraryA` and calling arbitrary WinAPI with parameters using `SetThreadContext` (optionally without suspending the thread).  
- The repo includes multiple delivery methods (e.g., `CreateRemoteThread`, `NtCreateThread`, and several APC queueing variants) and context manipulation approaches (ROP-gadget based vs. a two-step hijack).  
- It also includes utilities to create alertable threads to support APC-based execution paths and test reliability.  
- This is primarily useful for red teamers, pentesters, and malware researchers evaluating alternative injection tradecraft and for blue teamers studying detection opportunities around thread-context tampering and APC usage.

Technical Focus:
- Thread context manipulation (`CONTEXT`, `GetThreadContext`/`SetThreadContext`)
- Execution-only injection primitives (skipping remote alloc/write where possible)
- Remote thread creation via Win32 and NT APIs (`CreateRemoteThread`, `NtCreateThread`)
- APC-based execution (`QueueUserAPC`, `NtQueueApcThread*`, alertable threads)
- ROP gadget usage for controlled execution redirection
- ETW-related thread creation “noise” experimentation (project folder indicates focus)

Use Cases:
- Evaluate stealthier alternatives to common process injection patterns in Windows engagements
- Prototype and compare thread-context hijacking variants (suspend vs. non-suspend, ROP vs. two-step)
- Test APC injection reliability by generating/identifying alertable threads
- Develop detections/hunts for `SetThreadContext` abuse, APC queueing, and unusual thread start patterns
- Research tradeoffs between Win32 vs. NT-native thread creation telemetry
