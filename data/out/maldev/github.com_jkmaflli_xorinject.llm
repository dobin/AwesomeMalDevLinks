Title:
XOR Encrypted Shellcode Execution via Desktop Enumeration (xorInject)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository contains a Boo (.NET) script that executes XOR-encrypted shellcode by abusing Windows desktop window enumeration callbacks.  
- It decrypts shellcode at runtime (XOR), allocates executable memory, copies the decrypted payload, and triggers execution via `EnumDesktopWindows` using a delegate callback.  
- The technique is positioned as an alternative to more common thread-creation execution patterns, aiming to blend execution into benign-looking GUI enumeration behavior.  
- Shellcode is represented as MAC-address formatted bytes, then converted back into raw bytes before execution.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers, pentesters, and malware developers exploring .NET-based loaders and callback execution primitives.  
- The interesting aspect is the combination of uncommon language choice (Boo), simple obfuscation, and callback-based execution through user32 APIs.

Technical Focus:
- XOR runtime decryption / lightweight shellcode obfuscation  
- Callback-based code execution via `EnumDesktopWindows`  
- Win32 memory allocation/protection (`VirtualAlloc`, `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE`)  
- Desktop context handling (`GetThreadDesktop`)  
- .NET interop / delegates for unmanaged callbacks (P/Invoke)  
- Shellcode encoding/decoding (MAC-address formatted byte strings)

Use Cases:
- Building or testing alternative Windows shellcode execution chains using GUI callbacks  
- Prototyping .NET/Boo-based loaders for tradecraft experimentation  
- Evaluating EDR detections around `VirtualAlloc` + RWX + callback execution patterns  
- Training/education on Windows callback execution primitives and P/Invoke in .NET
