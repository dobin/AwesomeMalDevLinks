Title:
DLL Forward Sideloading (Indirect DLL Sideloading via Export Forwards)

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- The post analyzes Windows DLL export forwarding and shows how it can be abused to achieve an “indirect” DLL sideloading primitive.  
- The key idea is to find an exported function that forwards to a target DLL that is *not* a KnownDLL, so the loader will search and load it from the attacker-controlled directory.  
- On Windows 11, the author identifies `keyiso.dll` exporting `KeyIsoSetAuditingInterface` which forwards to `NCRYPTPROV.SetAuditingInterface`, where `NCRYPTPROV.dll` is not a KnownDLL.  
- By running `rundll32.exe c:\test\keyiso.dll,KeyIsoSetAuditingInterface` with a malicious `NCRYPTPROV.dll` placed alongside, Windows loads the attacker’s payload DLL and executes its `DllMain` during load.  
- This extends classic signed-binary sideloading by chaining: signed `rundll32.exe` → signed DLL → forwarded export → attacker-controlled DLL.  
- Useful for red teams and malware developers looking for new DLL search-order abuse paths; also relevant to defenders for hunting unusual forwarder-based load chains.

Technical Focus:
- PE export forwarding (forwarded exports)
- KnownDLLs and Windows DLL loader search order
- `rundll32.exe` execution of DLL exports
- Indirect DLL sideloading via forwarder resolution
- Identifying forwarders across OS DLLs (Win11 forward list generation)

Use Cases:
- Achieve code execution by planting a non-KnownDLL dependency targeted by a forwarded export
- Build signed-binary proxy chains (LOLBin `rundll32` + signed DLL) to load attacker DLLs
- Expand sideloading candidate discovery by enumerating forwarded exports in signed DLL corpora
- Defensive detection: hunt for `rundll32` loading uncommon DLLs from non-system paths and subsequent unexpected module loads
