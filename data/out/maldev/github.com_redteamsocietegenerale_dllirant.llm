Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
DLLirant is a Windows-focused tool that automates discovery of DLL search-order hijacking opportunities and assists with DLL proxying against a specified PE (EXE or DLL). It addresses the manual effort of enumerating imported DLLs/exports and repeatedly crafting test DLLs to confirm whether a target binary will load attacker-controlled libraries. The tool parses PE imports (via PeNet), generates custom DLLs exporting required functions, and iteratively tests them to detect execution paths that confirm hijacking viability (dropping a marker file at `C:\DLLirant\output.txt`). When a candidate is found, it generates proof-of-concept artifacts and stores them (e.g., under a `dll-hijacks` directory) alongside an output directory containing the staged target binary and dependencies. It also supports generating proxy DLLs that forward exports to a legitimate DLL while adding custom code. This is primarily useful for red teams and pentesters performing local privilege escalation/persistence tradecraft validation, and for defenders/researchers auditing software for unsafe DLL loading behavior.

Technical Focus:
- DLL search order hijacking (load-order abuse) on Windows
- PE import table parsing and dependency enumeration (PeNet)
- Automated DLL generation with matching exported functions
- DLL proxying / export forwarding stubs
- PoC generation and execution confirmation via filesystem marker
- Handling missing dependencies via staged `import`/`output` directories

Use Cases:
- Rapidly triage third-party executables for DLL hijacking candidates
- Generate working PoCs for confirmed hijackable DLL names/exports
- Build proxy DLLs to wrap legitimate libraries while adding payload logic
- Validate application hardening (SafeDllSearchMode, known DLLs, proper paths)
- Support software supply-chain/security reviews of Windows applications
