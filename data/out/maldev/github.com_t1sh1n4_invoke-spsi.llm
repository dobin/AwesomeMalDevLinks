Title:
Invoke-SPSI – Simple PowerShell Shellcode Injector

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
Invoke-SPSI is a PowerShell-based shellcode injector that decrypts an XOR-encrypted payload in memory and injects it into a remote target process. It uses a .NET D/Invoke approach to call Win32 APIs without traditional P/Invoke signatures, aiming to reduce static detection. The repository includes a small Python helper (xor.py) to XOR-encode raw shellcode and a PowerShell script (Invoke-SPSI.ps1) that fetches the encrypted payload from disk or URL, decrypts it, and performs remote process injection. The author positions it as a CTF/lightweight lab tool demonstrating that even fully updated Windows Defender can be bypassed with simple techniques and highly signatured payloads (e.g., Meterpreter) under certain conditions. It explicitly states it is not intended to bypass modern EDR or paid AV. Useful primarily for red teamers/pentesters in controlled environments and for defenders studying basic in-memory decryption + injection tradecraft.

Technical Focus:
- PowerShell in-memory payload decryption (XOR)
- .NET D/Invoke for Win32 API invocation
- Remote process injection workflow
- Payload staging via HTTP (IWR/IEX) or local file
- Basic AV evasion via obfuscation/encryption (not EDR-grade)

Use Cases:
- Demonstrating simple shellcode injection chains in labs/CTFs
- Testing Windows Defender signature/heuristic gaps with encrypted payloads
- Building a minimal PowerShell stager + injector for training
- Blue team validation of detections around remote injection and memory allocation
