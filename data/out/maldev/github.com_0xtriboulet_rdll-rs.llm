Title:
rdll-rs — Reflective DLL development template for Rust

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- rdll-rs is a Rust project template for building Windows payloads as a standard DLL, a normal EXE for easier debugging, or a reflective DLL suitable for in-memory loading.  
- It integrates hasherezade’s pe_to_shellcode (pe2shc) to convert the compiled DLL into a reflective/stomp-compatible artifact, and provides guidance for using prepend-style loaders (sRDI) vs legacy stomp loaders.  
- The template demonstrates Windows API usage via Rust FFI, proper exports/DllMain handling, and a build workflow using an `xtask` helper.  
- It includes a “hacky” named-pipe output mechanism plus an Aggressor (.cna) script to inject the reflective DLL and relay output back to Cobalt Strike Beacon.  
- It’s useful for red teamers/pentesters and implant developers who want Rust ergonomics (Cargo/crates) while producing reflective DLL tradecraft compatible with common C2 workflows.  
- The interesting angle is combining reflective DLL patterns with Rust’s dependency ecosystem and providing practical C2 integration (pipe stomping, Beacon tasking) out of the box.

Technical Focus:
- Reflective DLL generation (stomp vs prepend/sRDI loader compatibility)
- Rust Windows development (cdylib, exports, DllMain lifecycle)
- Windows API integration via FFI (Rust ↔ C bridge)
- pe_to_shellcode / PE-to-shellcode conversion pipeline
- Cobalt Strike Aggressor scripting (bdllinject, CommandBuilder) and named pipes
- Build automation with Cargo + `xtask` + CMake submodules

Use Cases:
- Build a reflective DLL payload in Rust for in-memory injection workflows
- Rapidly test DLL logic as an EXE before deploying as a DLL/reflective DLL
- Integrate custom Rust capabilities (crates) into a DLL-based implant module
- Send execution output from an injected reflective DLL back to Beacon via named pipes
- Adapt artifacts for different reflective loaders (legacy stomp vs modern prepend)
