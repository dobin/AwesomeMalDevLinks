Title:
Hell’s Gate – Original C Implementation of the Hell’s Gate VX Technique

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository contains the original C (with some assembly) implementation accompanying the “Hell’s Gate” paper by Paul Laîné and smelly__vx.  
- It demonstrates a Windows evasion technique for performing direct/indirect system calls by dynamically resolving NT syscall numbers from ntdll at runtime rather than relying on imported WinAPI stubs.  
- The approach is commonly used to reduce user-mode API hooking visibility (e.g., by EDR) by invoking syscalls more directly.  
- The included code serves as a reference implementation for extracting syscall IDs and building syscall stubs, and the repo also ships the PDF paper.  
- It’s primarily useful for red team operators, malware developers, and security researchers studying Windows internals and user-mode monitoring bypass patterns.  
- It’s interesting because it captures a widely reused syscall-resolution pattern in a compact, reproducible form that can be adapted into loaders/implants.

Technical Focus:
- Windows NT syscalls and syscall number resolution
- ntdll parsing / export table inspection
- Direct/indirect syscall stubs (syscall; ret)
- User-mode API hooking evasion concepts
- C/ASM interop for low-level Windows execution

Use Cases:
- Building implants/loaders that avoid calling hooked WinAPI functions
- Researching and reproducing syscall-based evasion tradecraft
- Creating test samples to validate EDR/user-mode hook detections
- Teaching/learning Windows syscall mechanics and ntdll internals
