Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
CelestialSpark V2 is a modern 64-bit position-independent Windows reverse_TCP staging shellcode intended to be compatible with Meterpreter and Sliver staging workflows, built on top of Cracked5pider’s Stardust v2 shellcode template. It targets the problem of legacy msfvenom Meterpreter reverse_tcp stagers being heavily signatured by AV/EDR by re-implementing core networking and staging logic in a smaller, custom PIC codebase. The project hardcodes byte-order helpers (htons/htonl), implements a custom inet_addr, and dynamically resolves/imports Winsock APIs from ws2_32.dll rather than relying on standard imports. It leverages Stardust’s compile-time hashing (FNV1a) and PEB-based module resolution to avoid cleartext API/module references and to remain position independent. It’s primarily useful for red teamers, pentesters, and implant developers experimenting with custom stagers and shellcode engineering, and secondarily for defenders wanting realistic samples for detection engineering. The repo includes build tooling (Make/CMake, mingw) and is designed to be used with external shellcode loaders/injectors.

Technical Focus:
- Position-independent (PIC) Windows x64 shellcode design
- PEB-based module enumeration and dynamic API resolution
- Compile-time hashing (FNV1a) for module/function name resolution
- Winsock (ws2_32.dll) reverse TCP socket creation and communication
- Staged payload delivery/execution logic (Meterpreter/Sliver-style stager)
- Shellcode build pipeline (mingw, Make/CMake) and loader compatibility

Use Cases:
- Generate custom reverse_TCP stager shellcode with configurable IP/port
- Replace/augment msfvenom stagers to reduce static IoCs in engagements
- Integrate with shellcode loaders/injectors (process injection, in-memory execution)
- Research/learn PIC shellcode patterns, PEB walking, and hashed API resolving
- Create detection test cases for staged reverse TCP shellcode behavior
