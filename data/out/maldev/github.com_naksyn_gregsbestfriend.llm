Title:
GregsBestFriend – Bypassing AV/EDR and Building with Different Compilers

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- GregsBestFriend is a C++ offensive development sample/tool from the White Knight Labs course that demonstrates AV/EDR evasion concepts alongside process injection-oriented code.  
- The main idea is that compiling the same source with different toolchains (MSVC/cl.exe, GCC/g++, Clang variants) produces materially different binaries, which can change static signatures and detection outcomes.  
- The repository includes build setups for multiple compilers and highlights how compiler choice/flags can influence executable uniqueness and optimization.  
- It also implements basic sandbox-evasion heuristics such as wasting CPU cycles via a large loop and checking the executable name for an expected string (to detect sandbox renaming).  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers, pentesters, and offensive tool developers experimenting with build pipelines and basic evasion tradecraft; it’s also relevant to blue teams for understanding how trivial build changes can affect detections.  
- The project emphasizes operational considerations like avoiding VirusTotal submissions to reduce signature burn.

Technical Focus:
- Windows offensive C++ development and process injection scaffolding
- AV/EDR evasion via compiler/toolchain diversity (MSVC vs GCC vs Clang)
- Binary variance through compiler optimizations and flags
- Basic sandbox/analysis evasion (sleep/CPU burn, filename checks)
- Build engineering for multiple Windows compiler environments

Use Cases:
- Generate multiple functionally equivalent payload binaries with different compiler fingerprints
- Test how EDR detections vary across MSVC/Clang/GCC builds and optimization settings
- Use as a starter template for custom injection loaders in C++
- Evaluate sandbox behavior against simple anti-analysis checks (renaming, time/CPU constraints)
- Blue-team validation: build-based evasion awareness and detection engineering exercises
