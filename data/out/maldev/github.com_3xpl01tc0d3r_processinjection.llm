Title:
ProcessInjection

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- A C# program that demonstrates multiple Windows process injection techniques and execution methods in a single tool.  
- It solves the need for a modular lab/PoC framework to compare injection tradeoffs (API-based vs syscall-based, different payload formats, and different injection primitives).  
- Supported techniques include vanilla remote thread injection, DLL injection, process hollowing, APC queue injection, and KernelCallbackTable injection.  
- It supports multiple invocation styles (P/Invoke, D/Invoke, direct syscalls, indirect syscalls) and basic evasion options like PPID spoofing and XOR/AES-encrypted shellcode.  
- Payloads can be provided as base64/hex/C/raw, loaded from disk/URL, and the assembly can be reflectively loaded (e.g., via PowerShell).  
- Useful for red teamers, pentesters, and malware researchers for technique prototyping, and for blue teams to build detections around common injection behaviors and syscall patterns.

Technical Focus:
- Windows process injection primitives (remote thread, APC, hollowing, KCT)
- P/Invoke vs D/Invoke (Dynamic Invoke) tradeoffs
- Direct and indirect syscalls for user-mode API bypass
- Shellcode handling (formats, remote loading, in-memory execution)
- PPID spoofing and basic payload encryption (XOR/AES)
- .NET reflective assembly loading / in-memory execution

Use Cases:
- Rapid testing of multiple injection techniques against EDR/AV in a controlled lab
- Building/validating detections for injection behaviors (memory allocation, RWX, thread start, APC, hollowing indicators)
- Comparing telemetry differences between Win32 API calls vs syscall-based execution
- Operator tradecraft experimentation (PPID spoofing, encrypted payload staging, remote shellcode retrieval)
- Educational reference for implementing injection techniques in C#
