Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository contains a Go-based Windows shellcode loader that embeds payloads in the PE resource section and executes them in-memory.  
- It extracts hex-encoded shellcode from a custom manifest/resource blob (delimited by `#!` and `$!`), decodes it, allocates RWX memory, writes the payload, and starts execution via a new thread.  
- The loader uses a mix of Win32 resource APIs (e.g., `FindResourceW`, `LoadResource`) and direct NT syscalls (`NtAllocateVirtualMemory`, `NtWriteVirtualMemory`, `NtCreateThreadEx`, `NtWaitForSingleObject`) to reduce reliance on higher-level APIs commonly monitored by EDR.  
- It includes a simple hash/XOR + SHA-1 based identifier scheme for syscall-related strings/IDs (basic obfuscation).  
- The workflow documents generating shellcode (e.g., msfvenom), embedding it using `rsrc` (manifest resource), and compiling a GUI-mode binary.  
- Useful primarily for red teamers/pentesters and malware researchers studying resource-based payload staging and syscall-based injection patterns.

Technical Focus:
- PE resource section payload storage (manifest/resource type usage)
- Win32 resource extraction APIs (FindResourceW/LoadResource)
- Hex decoding and in-memory shellcode staging
- Direct NT syscalls for memory allocation/write/thread creation
- Basic string/hash obfuscation (XOR + SHA-1)
- Thread-based shellcode execution and synchronization (NtWaitForSingleObject)

Use Cases:
- Building a Windows in-memory shellcode loader with payloads stored in resources
- Testing EDR detections around resource extraction + RWX allocation + thread start
- Researching syscall-based injection tradeoffs vs. Win32 API usage
- Creating PoCs for defensive validation (YARA/EDR rules on resource-backed loaders)
