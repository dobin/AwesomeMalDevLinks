Title:
ADPT (Another DLL Proxying Tool)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- ADPT is a Rust-based toolchain that automates DLL proxying to exploit DLL hijacking/sideloading opportunities on Windows x64.  
- It reduces the manual work of identifying which exports are actually invoked, recreating function signatures, and building a compatible proxy DLL by using a tracing DLL and minimal assembly stubs.  
- The workflow generates an “ExportTracer” DLL to log called exports (to a file like `C:\Windows\Temp\result.log`), then generates a final proxy DLL that forwards all exports while executing a user payload in a chosen export.  
- It preserves original export ordinals and supports running the payload either on a new thread (Rust `std::thread` or `NtCreateThreadEx`) or on the calling thread to avoid process termination in sensitive binaries.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers/pentesters and malware developers doing tradecraft around DLL sideloading; defenders can use it to reproduce and validate hijack paths.  
- Limitations: you still need Procmon-like tooling to find the hijack point, payload is expected in Rust (though alternatives are mentioned), and only 64-bit DLLs are supported.

Technical Focus:
- Windows DLL hijacking / sideloading and proxy DLL generation
- Export tracing (runtime logging of invoked exported functions)
- Export forwarding with ordinal preservation
- Payload execution strategies (calling thread vs new thread)
- Native thread creation (`NtCreateThreadEx`) vs Rust threading
- Rust-based Windows offensive tooling build pipeline (release builds, linker quirks)

Use Cases:
- Rapidly weaponize discovered DLL search-order hijacks/sideloading in third-party apps
- Determine which DLL exports are actually used by a target binary without reversing
- Build proxy DLLs that keep application functionality while executing a payload
- Test “delayed import” sideloading scenarios (example: `TextShaping.dll` via `gdi32full.dll`)
- Reproduce and validate defensive detections for proxying/sideloading behaviors
