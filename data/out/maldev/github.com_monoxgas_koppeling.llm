Title:
Koppeling — Adaptive DLL Hijacking / Dynamic Export Forwarding (Demo + Export Cloning)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Koppeling is a demonstration project for advanced Windows DLL hijacking where a malicious DLL gains execution while still proxying all expected exports to the legitimate library.  
- It addresses the common problem of “entry point not found” crashes when a hijacked DLL does not correctly implement/forward the victim’s required exports, especially in dynamic import scenarios.  
- The repo includes a vulnerable harness app, a legitimate DLL, an “evil” DLL, and tooling to clone or rebuild export tables so the malicious DLL can seamlessly forward calls.  
- It showcases multiple proxying approaches: static forwarding via linker directives, post-build export cloning (C# and Python), and a more dynamic technique that rebuilds exports and patches import tables at runtime.  
- Useful for red teamers, pentesters, and malware developers studying reliable DLL proxying; also valuable for blue teams to understand realistic hijack implementations beyond trivial PoCs.  
- Interesting because it operationalizes “adaptive” hijacking—handling both static and dynamic sinks—rather than only demonstrating basic DLL search order abuse.

Technical Focus:
- DLL hijacking and proxy DLL design
- Export table cloning and export forwarding
- PE (Portable Executable) parsing/modification
- Import Address Table (IAT) patching / runtime import repair
- Static vs dynamic linking “sink” behaviors
- Tooling in C++, C#, and Python for PE manipulation

Use Cases:
- Build crash-free proxy DLLs for hijackable applications/services
- Test and validate DLL search order hijacking scenarios in lab environments
- Generate forwarder/proxy exports from a reference DLL automatically
- Research detection opportunities around export-forwarding and PE tampering
- Create realistic training examples for defenders (proxy DLL tradecraft)
