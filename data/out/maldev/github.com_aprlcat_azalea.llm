Title:
Azalea (GitHub repository) — content unavailable (404)

Type:
GitHub Tool (repository not accessible)

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
The provided GitHub link resolves to a 404 page, so the repository content (README, code, releases, and documentation) is not accessible from the extracted text. As a result, the tool’s purpose, threat model, and techniques cannot be verified or summarized. This commonly occurs when a repo is deleted, made private, renamed, or access-restricted. To produce a meaningful technical summary, the README text, a repo snapshot, or an alternative mirror link is required. If you can provide any extracted README/description or key files, I can summarize it in the requested format.

Technical Focus:
- Not determinable (repository content unavailable)
- GitHub access/visibility states (deleted/private/renamed)
- Content extraction limitations from 404 responses

Use Cases:
- Validate repository availability and access permissions before analysis
- Request/collect alternate sources (forks, mirrors, cached README) for tooling review
- Triage broken links in threat intel or toolchain documentation
