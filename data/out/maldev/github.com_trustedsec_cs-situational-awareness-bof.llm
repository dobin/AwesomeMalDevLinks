Title:
CS-Situational-Awareness-BOF (Situational Awareness BOF)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository provides a collection of “situational awareness” commands implemented as Cobalt Strike Beacon Object Files (BOFs) to run host and domain reconnaissance with a smaller operational footprint than spawning full processes.  
- It solves the need for quick pre-op checks (host, network, AD/LDAP, services, sessions, firewall, etc.) directly inside Beacon, reducing reliance on noisy built-in commands or external binaries.  
- The repo also serves as a BOF development reference, including a template/workflow (Makefiles, CNA integration) for building and adding new BOFs.  
- Techniques include Win32 API usage, COM-based ADCS enumeration, WMI querying, remote registry access, and LDAP security configuration testing (signing/channel binding).  
- It’s primarily useful for Red Teams and pentesters using Cobalt Strike, and secondarily for defenders studying common post-exploitation enumeration tradecraft.  
- Interesting due to breadth of practical enumeration coverage (including ADCS and LDAP security checks) and its role as a canonical BOF codebase/workflow.

Technical Focus:
- Cobalt Strike BOF development and CNA integration
- Windows Win32 API-based enumeration (processes, modules, services, sessions)
- Active Directory / LDAP querying and security configuration checks
- ADCS (Certificate Services) CA/template enumeration via Win32 and COM (ICertConfig, IX509PolicyServerListManager)
- Remote host enumeration (SMB sessions/shares, remote registry, scheduled tasks)
- DPAPI key material retrieval (DPAPI_SYSTEM, bootkey)

Use Cases:
- Pre-execution host triage (whoami, uptime, env, resources, firewall rules)
- Domain recon via LDAP searches and group/user enumeration
- Identify ADCS attack surface by enumerating CAs and certificate templates
- Validate LDAP hardening (LDAP signing / LDAPS channel binding) on DCs
- Detect potential EDR/AV presence via driver/service image path signature checks and loaded module inspection
- Remote enumeration of sessions, shares, services, scheduled tasks, and registry keys
