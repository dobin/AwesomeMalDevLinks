<p><a href="https://github.com/0xflux/Vectored-Exception-Handling-Squared" target="_blank">My GitHub proof of concept</a>.</p>

<p>Unless I am blind; there does not seem to be much out there (POC’s etc) relating to
the <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/crowdstrike-investigates-threat-of-patchless-amsi-bypass-attacks/" target="_blank">discovery made by CrowdStrike researchers</a>,
called Vectored Exception Handling Squared, or VEH². I want to say though, I do think
it’s really cool that CrowdStrike published this research - I would love to see more like this! My personal mantra for what
I do is: from offense comes better, deeper, defence.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike:</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxsec.red/static/images/baddies.png" alt="Are we the baddies Vectored Exception Handling malware"></p>

<p>Their research begins in a common place of abuse for malware, a place where malware can intercept certain
system calls a process may make when it is hunting for indicators of compromise. For example when malware tries to disable
AMSI scanning through the patching of <code>amsi.dll</code>. The act of doing this is tracked by MITRE
as <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001/" target="_blank">T1562.001</a>, <strong>Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools</strong>.</p>

<p>In this blog post we will look at implementing the Vectored Exception Handling Squared technique in Rust!</p>

<p>This is for understanding exception mechanics and detection surface; <strong>don’t deploy on systems you don’t own/have permission to test</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="theres-no-place-like-home">Theres no place like home</h2>

<p>To start at the beginning - for some time now malware has used direct patching to evade AMSI - this is patching the address in
<code>amsi.dll</code> (the <code>AmsiScanBuffer</code> function) with a return instruction; meaning when AMSI loads in the malware process to scan
some region of memory, the actual scan function wont run and it will just return out. In fact, I made
a <a href="https://fluxsec.red/etw-patching-rust" target="_blank">blog post</a> about this before, but with the Events Tracing for Windows stub, as opposed
to AMSI, but the concept is the same.</p>

<p>The problem with this, is its not particularly stealthy for an EDR or AV to pick up on. In fact, as you can
see in <a href="https://fluxsec.red/full-spectrum-event-tracing-for-windows-detection-in-the-kernel-against-rootkits" target="_blank">my post here</a>,
my EDR, <a href="https://github.com/0xflux/Sanctum" target="_blank">Sanctum</a>, can detect NTDLL tampering.</p>

<h2 id="enter-stage-right-vectored-exception-handling">Enter stage right Vectored Exception Handling</h2>

<p>Vectored Exception Handling (VEH) was introduced as an alternative way to ‘hook’ or prevent certain routines in memory from being dispatched,
which provides a mechanism such that you do not have to overwrite machine code in a loaded module (which can be detected
through hash changes etc, as I did with Sanctum).</p>

<p>VEH are a feature on Windows which allow software developers to register ‘callbacks’ (or.. handlers) when an exception occurs. An
example of this would be dereferencing a null pointer, take the below (rust) for example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust hljs" data-highlighted="yes"><span class="hljs-keyword">fn</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">main</span>() {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// A pointer to a u8 that itself is null</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> <span class="hljs-variable">a</span>: *<span class="hljs-keyword">mut</span> <span class="hljs-type">u8</span> = <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">null_mut</span>();
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Deref the null pointer</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">unsafe</span> { *a += <span class="hljs-number">1</span> }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In our program, this will generate an exception, either (if the compiler / LLVM is smart) a <strong>ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION</strong>, or more classically,
an <strong>ACCESS_VIOLATION</strong>.</p>

<p>Using VEH allows the programmer to create a callback for the process which says: “Anytime an exception occurs, run this code to see
if we can handle it in some special way”. This allows the developer to introspectively look at things such as register states and
what is on the stack. Quite helpful really.</p>

<p>We can add a VEH quite simply thanks
to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-addvectoredexceptionhandler" target="_blank">AddVectoredExceptionHandler</a>
from <strong>kernel32.dll</strong>.</p>

<p>These exist as an ordered handler list which the program can traverse to find an appropriate handler; allowing developers a little flexibility
when it comes to dealing with exceptions.</p>

<p>Hardware breakpoints are a feature of the CPU which use a number of special registers to trap access to things such as memory addresses,
meaning if the CPU accesses an address you wish to monitor, it will raise an exception. This is raised as <code>EXCEPTION_SINGLE_STEP</code>.</p>

<p>Security researchers / malware devs realised this raises an interesting opportunity. Take for example, a process dispatching the <strong>AmsiScanBuffer</strong>
function which uses AMSI to scan memory for IOCs, the malware developer can use a hardware breakpoint to raise an exception when the start of that
function is accessed by the CPU.</p>

<p>Hopefully if you follow; you should now see that a hardware breakpoint allows us to raise an exception which we can then receive an immediate
callback for - and this isn’t simply a callback that runs parallel, code execution goes to the handler before the program continues.</p>

<p>The below image taken from the intel handbook, shows the layout of the 8 debug registers.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxsec.red/static/images/bp.jpg" alt="Malware vectored exception handling squared"></p>

<p><strong>DR0</strong> - <strong>Dr3</strong> are designed to contain the addresses of the breakpoint - i.e. when an address we wish to monitor (such as <strong>AmsiScanBuffer</strong>) is
placed in one of these fields, on access, the program will raise the <strong>EXCEPTION_SINGLE_STEP</strong> exception.</p>

<p><strong>Dr6</strong> indicates which debug condition fired; for example, bit 0 (B0) is set when <strong>Dr0</strong> triggers.</p>

<p><strong>Dr7</strong>, or the <strong>Debug Control Register</strong>, is a bitmap, where essentially the lower 8 bits determine whether the breakpoint is turned on. The
even bits represent local breakpoints, and the odd bits represent the breakpoint being enabled globally. So bit 0 in <code>Dr7</code> = <code>Dr0</code> locally enabled.
The remaining bits in DR7 configure breakpoint type (execute / read / write) and size.</p>

<p>Thus, to enable <strong>Dr0</strong>, we would want the lower 8 bits of <code>Dr7</code> to be: <code>00000001</code>.</p>

<h2 id="its-a-trap">Its a trap</h2>

<p>From the exception handler, we receive a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-context" target="_blank">CONTEXT</a>, which
as you can see contains fields for things such as CPU registers (<code>rax</code>, <code>rsp</code>, <code>rip</code>, <code>etc</code>), but also includes the special debug registers
<code>Dr0</code> - <code>Dr7</code>. These are not readonly fields; this gives us volatile access to the actual registers.</p>

<p>Thus, you can manipulate the registers, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>rax</strong>: To spoof a return value.</li>
<li><strong>rip</strong>: To redirect the flow of execution.</li>
<li><strong>rsp</strong>: To manipulate the stack, to keep everything aligned as if it were a <strong>ret</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully you can see, we can manipulate these to prevent the CPU from executing a function where we manage to insert a hardware breakpoint for.</p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>So, this is where CrowdStrike come in with their research. In normal malware abuse of VEH, they would have to register the hardware breakpoints
for each thread by
calling <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-getthreadcontext" target="_blank">GetThreadContext</a>
and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-setthreadcontext" target="_blank">SetThreadContext</a>.
Naturally, this is an easy place for an EDR to intercept to look for signs of badness.</p>

<p>As the CrowdStrike blog points out - calling <code>SetThreadContext</code> transitions to <strong>NtSetContextThread</strong> in the kernel, and this makes a call
through to <strong>EtwWrite</strong>, which logs to the <code>Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Audit-API-Calls</code> provider. So clearly, EDR solutions have various
ways of detecting the VEH hooking of sensitive APIs malware devs want to avoid triggering.</p>

<h2 id="veh-squared">VEH Squared</h2>

<p>The CrowdStrike researcher who was looking at this problem came up with this excellent technique, VEH², which silently
registers a hardware breakpoint without having to go through <code>SetThreadContext</code>.</p>

<p>How do we do this? Well.. as we looked at above when we handle an interrupt, we get access to
the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-context" target="_blank">CONTEXT</a> struct, which gives us access to
the CPU’s volatile registers, including those responsible for hardware breakpoints!</p>

<p>So the strategy:</p>

<ol>
<li>Register a Vectored Exception Handler.</li>
<li>Trigger an exception, the most reliable way to do this would be through triggering a <strong>EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT</strong> via the <strong>int3</strong> assembly instruction.</li>
<li>In the VEH, when triggered from our code, modify the <strong>CONTEXT</strong> to set a hardware breakpoint to monitor access to the function pointer for <strong>AmsiScanBuffer</strong> (i.e. the first instruction of that function).</li>
<li>Have a specific code path within the VEH which checks for the enum which represents a <strong>EXCEPTION_SINGLE_STEP</strong>, which:

<ol>
<li>Modifies <strong>rax</strong> to be the result <strong>AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN</strong>.</li>
<li>Retrieves the value at the stack pointer (<strong>rsp</strong>) and puts this into the instruction pointer (this is the return address from the function once it is complete).</li>
<li>Add 8 to <strong>rsp</strong>; simulating the ret instruction behaviour (i.e. popping the return address from the top of the stack).</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>I have drawn this to help visualise what is going on:</p>

<p><img class="wide-img" src="https://fluxsec.red/static/images/veh.svg" alt="Vectored Exception Handling malware amsi evasion" width="300" height="150"></p>

<p>When writing the initial VEH, we need to work out how to continue execution as if nothing happened. In the above
steps, I listed we can issue an <strong>int3</strong> assembly instruction to trigger an exception. When we handle this in the VEH, we need to
continue executing our program. Well, how do we do that? We are currently in a bit of a bear cave!!</p>

<p>We need to take the <code>rip</code> where the breakpoint occurred and increment this by the length of the faulting instruction(s) such that
the program can resume from that point.</p>

<p>Compiling rust directly with <strong>rustc</strong>, we can output the compiled assembly via:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell hljs" data-highlighted="yes">cargo rustc --release -- --emit=asm -C llvm-args=--x86-asm-syntax=intel
</code></pre>

<p>And then read it into an obj dump file with the command:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell hljs" data-highlighted="yes">llvm-objdump -d --x86-asm-syntax=intel target\release\veh.exe &gt; f
</code></pre>

<p>If we open the (sloppily named) file, f, and we look for the size of an int3 instruction, we can see it is only 1 byte long,
of <strong>0xcc</strong>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell hljs" data-highlighted="yes">0000000140001000 &lt;.text&gt;:
140001000: 48 83 ec 28                 	sub	rsp, 0x28
140001004: ff d1                       	call	rcx
14000100c: cc                          	int3                        # *** this is what we are looking for 
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s now presume we were dealing with the below fault:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell hljs" data-highlighted="yes">1400010f7: 66 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00  	nop	word ptr [rax + rax]
140001100: c6 00 01                     mov byte ptr [rax], 1       # faults if RAX=0
140001103: 55                          	push	rbp
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming we are dereferencing a null pointer (rax=0) at address <strong>0x140001100</strong> - this will produce an access violation.
If we wanted to use this to trigger
the initial exception, then you would want to continue execution from the rest of the valid program, i.e. from address <strong>0x140001103</strong>,
so you would need to increment <strong>rip</strong> by 3, such that it will resume from <strong>0x140001103</strong>.</p>

<p>I would add, it is <strong>dangerous</strong> to be resuming from ACCESS_VIOLATIONs unless you know it occurred at a purposeful place you did this to
trigger such a violation - doing so randomly will almost certainly produce horrendous side effects in the host process.</p>

<p>If you <em>don’t</em> redirect <strong>rip</strong> away from the breakpoint address (or temporarily disable it), you can end up re-triggering the exception
immediately and entering a never ending loop…</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxsec.red/static/images/spinning_lol.jpeg" alt="Ahhhh a loop"></p>

<h3 id="a-caveat">A caveat</h3>

<p>Note that this needs to be applied per thread - however (as CS point out), AMSI scanning is performed within the same
thread loading the .NET assembly - so for AMSI patching, we gucci. I also expect, if malware is mostly single threaded, using this
technique to also prevent Events Tracing for Windows (in usermode) triggering, this would be acceptable. CS do note that COM usage
often involves the generation of several threads; so another caveat to consider.</p>

<h2 id="poc">POC</h2>

<p>So, to showcase a proof of concept; if successful the program will not print:
<strong>If this worked I should not print!!!! :(</strong> because we prevented the function from ever executing. To showcase the result up front:</p>

<h2 id="detection-opportunity">Detection opportunity</h2>

<p>Of course, as with everything in the cat and mouse game of cyber, there will be detection opportunity with this - perhaps in memory scanning of
VEH and the debug registers (perhaps from kernel mode, or even usermode). Thus, when thinking about using this on red team engagements, consider
your ‘offense in depth’ threat model of your target. Test on EDR’s you are going to face, and limit this to only been used when needed. Consider
removing the handler after the dotnet assembly has finished executing.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>
