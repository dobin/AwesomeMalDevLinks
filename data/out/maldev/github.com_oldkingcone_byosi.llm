Title:
BYOSI (Bring Your Own Scripting Interpreter)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- BYOSI is a PowerShell-based technique/toolchain to evade EDR by avoiding commonly hooked Windows APIs and instead executing payload logic through a trusted, code-signed scripting interpreter (PHP for Windows).  
- It targets an EDR blind spot where some products treat script files as inert text and focus detection on PE binaries, memory injection, and high-entropy sections rather than interpreter-driven script execution.  
- The workflow downloads and extracts a PHP Windows archive to `C:\Temp\php`, fetches a PHP “implant”/shell script, and runs it using the downloaded `php.exe` (signed by the vendor), leveraging trust/allowlisting that often applies to signed binaries.  
- The repo includes a PowerShell loader (`byosi.ps1`) and a PHP PoC (`poc.php`) demonstrating outbound connectivity/shell behavior under EDR monitoring.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teams and pentesters testing EDR coverage gaps around script scanning, interpreter abuse, and trusted download sources (e.g., GitHub).  
- It’s interesting because it reframes “living off the land” into “bring your own signed interpreter,” shifting detection from classic injection to process + script-content inspection and policy controls.

Technical Focus:
- Bring Your Own Interpreter (BYOI/BYOSI) execution model
- EDR user-mode API hooking avoidance via interpreter execution
- PowerShell staging/downloading and archive extraction
- Signed binary trust/allowlisting abuse (php.exe)
- Script file type scanning gaps (PHP) and AMSI/Defender visibility limitations
- Payload delivery via trusted hosting (GitHub) and network egress

Use Cases:
- Validate whether an EDR inspects script content executed by third-party interpreters
- Establish a foothold using a vendor-signed interpreter when unsigned binaries are blocked
- Simulate adversary tradecraft for “trusted binary + script payload” execution chains
- Purple-team detection engineering for interpreter spawning, unusual child processes, and script telemetry gaps
- Assess controls like AppLocker/WDAC, network egress filtering, and script scanning coverage
