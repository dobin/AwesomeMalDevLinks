Title:
SilentMoonwalk — Fully Dynamic Call Stack Spoofer (PoC)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- SilentMoonwalk is a proof-of-concept Windows x64 call stack spoofer that hides the real caller by manipulating stack unwinding metadata/behavior rather than only control flow.  
- It uses a ROP-based approach to desynchronize the unwinder’s view of the stack from the actual execution path, removing the original EXE image base from the visible call stack and restoring the original stack on return.  
- The repo demonstrates two approaches: a “Synthetic” mode that inserts fake frames (less robust) and a “Desync stack” mode that replaces unsuitable unwind frames with suitable ones to keep the stack looking legitimate and unwindable.  
- It targets scenarios where EDR/AV/anti-cheat products inspect user-mode call stacks to detect suspicious API invocation chains.  
- Includes an UnwindInspector utility to parse and display PE runtime function/unwind info (RUNTIME_FUNCTION / UNWIND_INFO) for selecting usable frames/gadgets.  
- Useful primarily for red team operators, offensive tool developers, and researchers studying call stack integrity, unwind-based detections, and evasion tradeoffs.

Technical Focus:
- Windows x64 stack unwinding (RUNTIME_FUNCTION, UNWIND_INFO, unwind codes)
- ROP chains and stack pivoting for control-flow/unwind desynchronization
- Call stack spoofing / return address spoofing variants
- Frame selection based on unwind semantics (e.g., POP RBP frames)
- User-mode telemetry evasion against call-stack-based detections
- PE exception handling / unwind metadata inspection

Use Cases:
- Spoofing call stacks for sensitive Windows API calls during post-exploitation
- Researching and testing EDR/AV call-stack validation heuristics
- Building/validating custom indirect syscall or API-call wrappers with plausible stacks
- Analyzing module unwind info to find viable gadgets/frames (via UnwindInspector)
- Demonstrating limitations and stability constraints of unwind/ROP-based spoofing
