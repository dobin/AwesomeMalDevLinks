Title:
Obex – DLL Blocking (Blocking unwanted DLLs in user mode)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
Obex is a proof-of-concept Windows user-mode technique/tool to prevent specific DLLs (e.g., EDR/monitoring components) from being loaded into a target process. It spawns an arbitrary process under debug control and blocks a configurable list of module names during early process initialization and also for later dynamic loads via `LoadLibrary*`. The default blocklist includes `amsi.dll`, demonstrating how to start PowerShell without AMSI being loaded. The project is implemented in plain C with no external dependencies and is intended as a practical reference for module-load interference from user mode. It’s primarily useful for red teams, pentesters, and malware researchers exploring defensive evasion and process initialization behavior, and for blue teams to understand and detect such tampering.

Technical Focus:
- Windows debugging APIs / debug-controlled process creation
- User-mode DLL load interception and blocking
- Process initialization and module load order
- `LoadLibrary*`-based dynamic module loading control
- Module enumeration/verification (loaded module list)

Use Cases:
- Launching a process while preventing specific security DLLs from loading (e.g., AMSI/EDR user-mode components)
- Researching and prototyping user-mode module-load blocking techniques
- Testing defensive detections around suspicious debug usage and missing expected modules
- Building controlled lab PoCs for process initialization and DLL load behavior
