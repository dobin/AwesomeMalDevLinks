Title:
Kernel Callbacks Removal (Bypassing EDR Detections)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository contains Windows kernel-mode techniques and PoCs for disabling or bypassing common EDR telemetry by removing/neutralizing kernel callback mechanisms.  
- It targets multiple monitoring surfaces used by EDRs, including process/thread/image notify routines, file system minifilter callbacks, network callout callbacks, and ETW Threat Intelligence (ETW-TI).  
- The projects rely on version-specific offsets and opcode/pattern scanning to locate internal kernel structures, with a strong warning that incorrect values can cause BSODs.  
- A highlighted “new” technique describes evading kernel-level verification by overwriting the callback function pointer inside a callback entry with a KCFG-compliant stub that returns, avoiding detections that watch the callback array itself (notably for notify routines).  
- It is primarily useful for red teamers, exploit developers, and security researchers studying kernel telemetry suppression, and for defenders validating assumptions about kernel-based detections.  
- The codebase emphasizes hands-on reversing/debugging workflows (WinDbg/IDA) to adapt to specific Windows builds (tested on Windows 11 build 26100).

Technical Focus:
- Kernel notify routines (PsSet*NotifyRoutine) callback discovery and tampering
- File system minifilter callback bypass (FltMgr / minifilters)
- Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) / network callout callback manipulation
- ETW Threat Intelligence (ETW-TI) suppression/bypass
- Pattern scanning, offsets, and build-specific kernel structure reversing
- KCFG (Kernel Control Flow Guard) constraints and compliant callback stubbing

Use Cases:
- Build a lab PoC to measure how an EDR depends on kernel callbacks for visibility
- Develop/modify kernel telemetry suppression techniques for controlled red team engagements
- Create detection engineering tests for callback integrity monitoring and tamper alerts
- Reverse Windows kernel structures per-build to understand callback registration internals
- Validate defensive assumptions around ETW-TI and kernel callback-based detections
