Title:
DLL Proxy Generator (namazso/dll-proxy-generator)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- A Rust CLI tool that generates a Windows “proxy DLL” for an arbitrary target DLL, forwarding exports to the real library while also loading a user-specified secondary DLL.  
- It solves the tedious/fragile work of manually creating export-forwarding stubs (including ordinal-based exports) needed for DLL proxying and side-loading scenarios.  
- The tool supports specifying extra imports (by name or ordinal), choosing the proxy target path (defaulting to the same DLL name in System32), and selecting the COFF machine type (e.g., x64).  
- This is useful for red teams/pentesters and malware developers for DLL search order hijacking / DLL sideloading tradecraft, and for defenders to reproduce and test these behaviors in a controlled way.  
- It’s notable because it automates correct export forwarding (including ordinals) and incorporates a known “target DLL trick” referenced from perfect-dll-proxy.

Technical Focus:
- Windows DLL proxying / export forwarding
- PE/COFF export tables and ordinal handling
- DLL search order hijacking / sideloading mechanics
- Import table manipulation (name/ordinal imports)
- Architecture targeting via COFF machine values (x86/x64)

Use Cases:
- Generate a proxy DLL to intercept/forward calls while executing custom code via a secondary DLL
- Build reproducible DLL sideloading test cases for application/EDR validation
- Rapidly create “drop-in” proxy replacements for System32 DLLs (lab environments)
- Validate handling of ordinal-only exports when crafting proxy libraries
