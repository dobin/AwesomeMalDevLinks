Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
Amber is a reflective (position-independent) PE loader/packer that converts native Windows PE files (EXE/DLL/SYS) into payloads intended for in-memory execution. It focuses on stealthy deployment by encoding the generated loader/payload (via the SGN encoder), resolving APIs in less obvious ways (CRC32_API or IAT_API), and wiping the reflective payload from memory after execution to reduce scanner visibility. The loader supports features like TLS callbacks and forwarded imports, and newer versions reduce reliance on high-signal Win32 APIs by switching to NTDLL functions; an experimental raw-syscall mode is available for x64. Payloads can be staged remotely or executed directly like shellcode. This is primarily useful for red teams, penetration testers, and malware researchers building custom in-memory loaders and studying PE reflective loading tradecraft. It’s interesting because it combines PE loading correctness (imports/TLS/forwarders) with multiple evasion-oriented implementation choices (encoding, API resolution strategy, memory wiping, syscall option).

Technical Focus:
- Reflective PE loading (PIC loader for EXE/DLL/SYS)
- In-memory execution and post-load payload wiping
- API resolution via hashing (CRC32) and IAT-based resolving
- SGN multi-pass encoding/obfuscation of payloads
- NTDLL-based loading and experimental raw syscalls (x64)
- Handling TLS callbacks and forwarded imports

Use Cases:
- Generate reflective payloads for in-memory execution during red team ops
- Build custom loaders for EXE/DLL deployment without dropping to disk
- Experiment with API-resolution tradeoffs (hashed vs IAT-based)
- Research/detect reflective loading behaviors (imports/TLS/forwarders, memory wiping)
- Create staged payload delivery workflows (remote fetch + in-memory run)
