Title:
ShadowStep — In-memory Encrypted Shellcode Execution Suite

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- ShadowStep is a Windows x64 research tool that executes encrypted shellcode such that the payload is never fully decrypted in memory; only a single instruction is briefly plaintext at any time.  
- It targets memory-scanning and signature-based detections by decrypting, executing, and immediately re-encrypting instructions in a custom single-step execution engine.  
- The approach avoids common single-step implementations that rely on trap flags, SEH/VEH registration, or breakpoint/debug-like artifacts, aiming to reduce observable indicators.  
- The repo includes a “Compiler” that transforms a raw shellcode blob into a custom executable and a “Runtime” project that implements the execution engine.  
- It uses Capstone for disassembly and currently supports XOR and RC4 encryption, with a design choice of x64-only shellcode.  
- Useful for red teamers, offensive security researchers, and defenders studying evasive in-memory execution and detection opportunities.

Technical Focus:
- Instruction-by-instruction (single-step) encrypted shellcode execution
- Windows process execution context swapping / virtualized context
- In-memory anti-scanning / reduced plaintext exposure
- Shellcode loader generation (compiler + runtime build pipeline via MSBuild)
- Capstone-based disassembly for instruction handling
- XOR/RC4 payload encryption

Use Cases:
- Wrap known shellcode to reduce static memory signature exposure during execution
- Integrate per-instruction decryption into a custom Windows loader
- Research and benchmark EDR memory-scanning resilience vs. “never-fully-decrypted” payloads
- Develop detections focused on behavioral artifacts rather than plaintext payload scanning
- Create controlled PoCs for reverse-engineering resistance experiments
