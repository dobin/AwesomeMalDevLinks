Title:
Tempest C2: Intro

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Introductory post describing the author’s Rust-based C2 framework “Tempest” and the design decisions behind building it as a learning/research project that became operationally useful.  
- It outlines the three core components: **anvil** (Linux C2 server with authenticated APIs, SQLite DB, build/shellcode utilities), **conduit** (cross-platform terminal TUI operator client), and **imps** (agents/beacons for Windows with Linux/macOS PoCs).  
- The post emphasizes OPSEC-oriented tradeoffs: HTTPS/TLS over port 443 for egress reliability, authenticated/unauth-discovery-resistant APIs, and minimizing “bloat” in post-ex modules.  
- Windows agent details include AES-encrypted comms over TLS, remote process injection, BOF/COFF support, in-memory .NET execution (noted as more detection-prone), WMI, and a “noldr” variant that resolves APIs via TEB→PEB walking instead of Ldr* calls.  
- It also covers practical operator guidance: prefer DLL/shellcode (sRDI/Donut workflows) embedded in custom droppers rather than running raw EXEs, and safer pivoting via a SOCKS proxy bound locally on the C2 server and accessed through SSH port forwarding.  
- Useful for red teamers, malware/C2 developers, and defenders studying modern Rust C2 architecture and common evasion/OPSEC patterns.

Technical Focus:
- Rust C2 architecture (server/operator client/agent separation)
- Authenticated HTTPS API design and “unauth discovery” resistance
- Windows API resolution via LdrGetDllHandle/LdrGetProcedureAddress vs TEB→PEB walking
- Post-ex tradeoffs: BOF/COFF loaders, in-memory .NET execution, WMI
- Remote process injection techniques in Rust
- Payload formats and shellcode generation (DLL → sRDI/Donut)

Use Cases:
- Build/modify a Rust C2 for research, training, or controlled red team operations
- Develop Windows implants with reduced static imports and alternative API resolution
- Execute BOFs/COFF post-ex modules through a custom loader
- Perform OPSEC-conscious lateral movement/pivoting using a constrained SOCKS proxy design
- Generate DLL/shellcode for embedding into bespoke initial access droppers
