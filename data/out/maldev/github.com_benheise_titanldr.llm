Title:
TitanLdr (Titan) – Reflective Loader for Cobalt Strike with DNS Beacon over DoH

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
TitanLdr is a Windows reflective loader written in C and assembly intended for use with Cobalt Strike payloads. It focuses on in-memory PE loading (reflective DLL/BOF-style loading concepts) and includes logic to redirect Cobalt Strike’s DNS Beacon traffic over DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) to blend C2 into HTTPS. The repository contains PE/PEB parsing code, hashing-based API resolution, and loader components typical of custom in-memory execution chains. It is primarily useful for red team operators and malware developers experimenting with custom loaders and alternate C2 transport paths. The interesting aspect is the combination of a bespoke reflective loader with DoH-based DNS beacon redirection, which can complicate network-based detection and egress controls.

Technical Focus:
- Reflective PE loading (manual mapping, relocations, import resolution)
- PEB walking / module enumeration for API resolution
- Hashed function name resolution
- C/assembly loader stubs and position-independent code
- DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) transport for DNS Beacon redirection
- Cobalt Strike integration (Aggressor script .cna)

Use Cases:
- Custom in-memory execution of Cobalt Strike payloads without standard loaders
- Experimenting with DoH as an alternative egress path for DNS-based C2
- Loader tradecraft R&D (API hashing, PEB-based resolution, minimal imports)
- Building test cases for EDR/network detections around reflective loading + DoH
