Title:
Unwinder — Call stack spoofing for Rust (SilentMoonWalk weaponization + stack replacement)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Unwinder is a Rust crate that implements stable, unwindable call stack spoofing on Windows by weaponizing the SilentMoonWalk technique.  
- It aims to defeat call-stack-based detections (e.g., EDR/userland scanners inspecting thread stacks) by producing “legitimate-looking” frames while executing arbitrary functions or indirect syscalls.  
- The crate exposes macros to call arbitrary function pointers or perform indirect syscalls with up to 11 parameters, returning the callee’s return value as `*mut c_void`.  
- It supports chaining spoofed calls without growing the visible call stack and uses TLS for efficiency; Windows API resolution is handled via `dinvoke_rs`.  
- An additional experimental “stack replacement” mode maintains a clean call stack throughout execution by dynamically swapping return addresses with offsets into legitimate functions of matching frame size, restoring the original return address before `ret`.  
- This is primarily useful for red teams, pentesters, and malware developers building Rust implants/loaders who need stealthier execution traces.

Technical Focus:
- SilentMoonWalk call stack spoofing (unwind-info-aware stack manipulation)
- Indirect syscalls with spoofed/unwindable stacks
- Return address spoofing, concealment frames, `jmp rbx`-style trampolines
- TLS-assisted per-thread state for spoofing
- Dynamic API resolution/invocation via `dinvoke_rs`
- Experimental stack replacement with frame-size matching and runtime offset selection

Use Cases:
- Building Rust-based loaders/implants with reduced call-stack anomalies
- Executing Windows APIs (e.g., `Sleep`, `OpenProcess`, `LoadLibraryA`) under spoofed stacks
- Performing NT syscalls (e.g., `NtDelayExecution`) via indirect syscall paths while preserving plausible stacks
- Evading tools that flag suspicious thread call stacks (e.g., PE-sieve `/threads`) during in-memory execution
- Reflective DLL injection scenarios where exported entrypoints wrap stack replacement start/end
