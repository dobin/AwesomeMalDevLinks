Title:
CopyReadProcessMemory

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository provides a Windows PoC/tool that abuses the `ReadProcessMemory` API’s `lpNumberOfBytesRead` out-parameter as a write primitive to modify memory without using typical copy/write routines (e.g., `memcpy` / `WriteProcessMemory`).  
- The goal is to support payload staging/injection workflows while reducing common AV/EDR detections that focus on standard memory-writing APIs and hooked paths (notably `NtReadProcessMemory`).  
- It supports loading payloads from a local file, a raw string, or a remote URL, and can optionally execute the processed payload.  
- The project also includes XOR de-obfuscation (`-x`) and a helper Python script to XOR payloads before delivery.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teams, pentesters, and offensive security researchers exploring alternative memory manipulation primitives and EDR evasion tradecraft.

Technical Focus:
- Windows `ReadProcessMemory` semantics and out-parameter abuse (`lpNumberOfBytesRead`)
- Memory write/injection primitives without `WriteProcessMemory`/`memcpy`
- User-mode API hooking/EDR evasion considerations (e.g., `NtReadProcessMemory` hooks)
- Payload staging: local file, command-line string, remote HTTP retrieval
- In-memory XOR de-obfuscation and execution flow

Use Cases:
- Proof-of-concept demonstrating a nonstandard process-memory write technique via `ReadProcessMemory`
- Payload staging/injection experiments designed to avoid common API-based detections
- Red-team tradecraft testing against EDR user-mode hooks and telemetry
- Lab research into Windows API misuses and defensive detection gaps
- Obfuscated shellcode delivery and in-memory decode (XOR) prior to execution
