Title:
Exploiting DLL Hijacking by DLL Proxying Super Easily (dll-hijack-by-proxying)

Type:
GitHub Tool (tutorial + PoC code)

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository demonstrates how to exploit Windows DLL hijacking reliably using “DLL proxying” (a proxy DLL that forwards exports to the real DLL while running attacker code).  
- It addresses the common problem where naive replacement DLLs crash the target application due to missing/incorrect exports or behavior.  
- The technique uses a generated `.def` file to forward all exported functions (including ordinals) to a renamed legitimate DLL (e.g., `version_orig.dll`), while executing a payload from `DllMain()`.  
- It includes a Python script (`gen_def.py`) using `pefile` to extract exports from a legitimate DLL and emit the forwarding `.def` file automatically.  
- The build workflow emphasizes cross-compiling Windows proxy DLLs from Linux using `mingw-w64`.  
- Useful for red teamers/pentesters developing stable DLL hijack payloads and for defenders understanding how hijacks can be made non-disruptive and stealthier.

Technical Focus:
- Windows DLL search order / DLL hijacking mechanics
- Proxy DLL export forwarding via Module-Definition (`.def`) files
- PE export table parsing with Python `pefile`
- `DllMain()` execution and payload staging
- Cross-compilation with `mingw-w64` (i686-w64-mingw32-gcc)
- Discovery/validation with Sysinternals Process Monitor

Use Cases:
- Build non-crashing hijack DLLs for vulnerable portable/side-loaded Windows apps
- Rapidly generate export-forwarding stubs for arbitrary target DLLs
- Create PoCs for DLL search order issues found during assessments
- Reproduce and validate DLL hijack findings with realistic “works normally” behavior
- Blue-team testing: simulate proxy-hijack tradecraft for detections/hardening
