ProcessStomping

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- ProcessStomping is a proof-of-concept Windows process injection technique described as a variation of hasherezade’s Process Overwriting.  
- Instead of overwriting an entire PE image in the target process, it writes shellcode into a chosen executable section and redirects execution to it.  
- The core flow is: create a target process suspended (CreateProcess + CREATE_SUSPENDED), write the payload into the target (WriteProcessMemory), change the primary thread’s start context to the new code (SetThreadContext), then resume execution (ResumeThread).  
- The repo demonstrates pairing the technique with sRDI to execute a reflective-loaderless DLL (e.g., a beacon) as shellcode, including optional XOR encoding and network delivery of the blob.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers, pentesters, and malware developers exploring user-mode injection tradecraft and section-based payload placement.  
- It’s interesting because it highlights a practical alternative to full image replacement and calls out detection opportunities around suspended process creation + thread context manipulation.

Technical Focus:
- Process Overwriting variant (“Process Stomping”) and section-based shellcode placement  
- Suspended process creation and primary thread hijacking  
- Remote memory writing (WriteProcessMemory) and entrypoint redirection (SetThreadContext)  
- sRDI (Shellcode Reflective DLL Injection) / reflective-loaderless DLL execution  
- Payload encoding/obfuscation (XOR) and simple network staging  
- Detection surface: CREATE_SUSPENDED + context change + rapid ResumeThread sequence

Use Cases:
- Execute shellcode from a specific mapped section of a legitimate process
- Stage and run sRDI-converted DLL payloads (e.g., C2 beacons) without a custom reflective loader
- Experiment with injection tradeoffs vs. classic process hollowing/overwriting
- Build detections for suspicious suspended-process + thread-context modification patterns
