Title:
Dittobytes — Metamorphic cross-compilation of C/C++ to PIC, BOF & EXE

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Dittobytes is a build system and custom LLVM-based toolchain that compiles C/C++ into truly position-independent code (PIC) shellcode, Beacon Object Files (BOF/COFF), and minimal executables across Windows, Linux, and macOS for AMD64 and ARM64.  
- It solves the common need for small, loader-less shellcode by compiling code directly to PIC without relying on reflective loaders (e.g., Donut/sRDI) or polymorphic decrypt stubs.  
- The project includes a metamorphic engine implemented as LLVM passes that introduce randomized, functionally equivalent instruction-level transformations so each build produces unique shellcode.  
- An intermediate LLVM Function Pass inlines constants to avoid `.rodata` dependencies, and a MachineFunction pass performs metamorphic transformations like register randomization and instruction substitution.  
- It ships example payload code, per-platform loaders for testing, and a feature-test suite to validate transformations.  
- Useful for red teams, offensive tool developers, and malware researchers interested in cross-platform PIC generation and evasion-oriented compilation techniques.

Technical Focus:
- Position Independent Code (PIC) generation from C/C++
- LLVM pass development (Function Pass, MachineFunction Pass)
- Metamorphic transformations (register allocation randomization, instruction substitution, nullification transforms)
- Cross-compilation toolchains (Windows/Linux/macOS; AMD64/ARM64)
- BOF/COFF artifact generation and `.text` segment extraction
- API self-resolution constraints for shellcode-style payloads

Use Cases:
- Generate loader-less PIC shellcode from custom C payloads for multiple OS/architectures
- Produce Cobalt Strike-compatible BOFs from the same codebase
- Create minimal “PIC-only” executables with constants inlined (reduced non-`.text` dependencies)
- Build metamorphic variants of payloads to diversify static signatures across compilations
- Research/benchmark metamorphic compilation and detection resilience using provided tests/loaders
