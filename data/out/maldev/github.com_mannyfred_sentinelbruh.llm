Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
SentinelBruh is an archived, “dirty” proof-of-concept demonstrating how SentinelOne’s use of Vectored Exception Handling (VEH) can be abused to perform vectored syscalls and enable local code execution techniques. The core idea is to leverage exception-driven control flow (VEH handlers) to transition into syscall execution paths in a way that can evade or interfere with user-mode monitoring/hooking approaches. It references prior work on dumping VEH handler chains, implementing syscalls via VEH, and detecting anomalous VEH handlers. The repo is explicitly labeled outdated and not recommended for reuse, but it documents a technique class relevant to EDR evasion research. Useful primarily for red team tradecraft R&D, malware dev experimentation, and blue team detection engineering around VEH abuse.

Technical Focus:
- Windows Vectored Exception Handling (VEH) internals and handler chaining
- Syscalls via exception-driven control flow (“vectored syscalls”)
- User-mode EDR/AV hooking and bypass surface
- VEH handler discovery/dumping and anomaly detection concepts
- Local execution primitives leveraging exception handlers

Use Cases:
- Prototype research into EDR user-mode monitoring bypass via VEH-mediated syscalls
- Build detections for suspicious VEH registration/handler patterns in endpoints
- Study how security products’ exception handlers can be repurposed by attackers
- Reproduce and validate “vectored syscalls” techniques in a lab environment
