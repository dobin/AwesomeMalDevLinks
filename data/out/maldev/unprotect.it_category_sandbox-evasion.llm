Title:
Unprotect.it – Sandbox Evasion Techniques (Category Index)

Type:
Documentation

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This page is an index of sandbox/analysis evasion techniques curated by Unprotect.it, mapping each technique to internal IDs (e.g., U13xx) and sometimes external references (e.g., MITRE T1497.002).  
- It covers a broad set of checks malware can use to detect virtualized or instrumented environments, including timing-based delays, hardware/VM artifact discovery, user-interaction gating, and anti-hooking checks.  
- The techniques reference common Windows APIs (e.g., EnumProcesses, GetForegroundWindow, NtDelayExecution) and low-level CPU/VM detection instructions (e.g., CPUID, SIDT/“Red Pill”, SLDT/“No Pill”, RDTSCP).  
- The list also includes environment heuristics (RAM/disk size, screen resolution, printers/USB presence, hostname/username, domain membership) and virtualization-specific indicators (Hyper‑V signature, VBox shares, QEMU/Bochs quirks).  
- It’s useful for red teams and malware analysts to understand common evasion patterns, and for blue teams to build detections, harden sandboxes, and prioritize telemetry collection.  
- Its value is in the structured cataloging of many evasion primitives in one place, enabling quick cross-referencing and coverage assessment.

Technical Focus:
- VM/sandbox detection via CPU instructions (CPUID, RDTSCP, SIDT/SLDT, STR, SMSW)
- Timing attacks and sleep/delay evasion (time APIs, NtDelayExecution, time bombs, stalling)
- Windows API–based environment discovery (process/service enumeration, foreground window, WMI)
- Virtualization artifact checks (files, folders, processes, pipes, MAC/OUI, Hyper‑V/VBox/QEMU)
- User-interaction and “human presence” heuristics (mouse activity, recent files, wallpaper)
- Anti-instrumentation/anti-hooking checks (detecting hooked functions)

Use Cases:
- Build or evaluate sandbox/EDR evasion test cases for malware simulation
- Create detection analytics for suspicious environment-check bursts (API hammering, VM probes)
- Harden analysis environments by reducing obvious VM artifacts and realistic user activity
- Map defensive telemetry requirements (API calls, WMI, registry/filesystem, CPU feature queries)
- Threat research: classify samples by evasion families and techniques used
