Title:
WithSecureLabs ModuleStomping (Countercept) – Hiding Malicious Code with Module Stomping

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository contains proof-of-concept code and supporting materials for Countercept/WithSecure research on “module stomping,” a Windows code-injection/evasion technique.  
- The core idea is to load a legitimate module into a process and overwrite (“stomp”) parts of that module’s mapped image/sections with attacker-controlled payload code, then execute it, aiming to blend into normal module-backed memory rather than obvious anonymous RWX regions.  
- The repo includes multiple components (injectors, payloads/utilities, a driver, and a UI) corresponding to parts of the accompanying blog series, with documentation included in the `documentation` directory.  
- It focuses on practical implementation details of manipulating PE sections and process memory to host and run shellcode under the guise of a legitimate DLL/module mapping.  
- Useful primarily for red teams, pentesters, and malware researchers studying injection tradecraft and EDR detection gaps; also relevant for blue teams building detections around suspicious module section modifications and execution flow.  
- Interesting because it demonstrates an alternative to classic VirtualAlloc-based injection patterns by abusing the trust/structure of loaded modules.

Technical Focus:
- Windows process injection and in-memory execution
- PE/module mapping and section manipulation (“stomping”)
- Memory protections and executable page transitions
- User-mode injection tooling plus kernel driver support
- Evasion tradeoffs vs. common RWX/anonymous memory heuristics

Use Cases:
- Implementing and testing module-stomping style payload staging in controlled assessments
- Evaluating EDR visibility/detections for modified module-backed memory regions
- Building defensive analytics for module section integrity and anomalous execution
- Researching alternative injection primitives beyond classic remote allocation + WriteProcessMemory
