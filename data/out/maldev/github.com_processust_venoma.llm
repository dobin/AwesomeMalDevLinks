Title:
Venoma — C++ Cobalt Strike Beacon Dropper with API Hashing and Indirect Syscalls

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Venoma is a Windows C++ “raw” Cobalt Strike beacon dropper focused on AV/EDR evasion during payload staging and execution.  
- It combines compile-time API hashing and runtime dynamic linking to reduce static indicators (imports/strings) and complicate analysis.  
- The project includes multiple execution and stealth techniques such as PPID spoofing, DLL unhooking (including “Fresh + Perun’s fart”), ETW patching, and indirect syscall execution to bypass user-mode hooks.  
- It supports several payload execution methods (EnumPageFilesW, local/remote APC) and includes self-deletion for post-execution cleanup.  
- It also documents integration with the Cobalt Strike Artifact Kit workflow (renaming to artifact64big.exe and using a custom CNA) to generate stageless Windows payloads.  
- Useful primarily for red teams, pentesters, and malware researchers evaluating defensive coverage and detection gaps around common loader tradecraft.

Technical Focus:
- Compile-time API hashing / IAT obfuscation
- Runtime dynamic API resolution (dynamic linking)
- Indirect syscalls (hook evasion)
- DLL unhooking (fresh mapping / “Perun’s fart” technique)
- ETW patching (telemetry suppression)
- APC-based and callback-based execution (EnumPageFilesW, local/remote APC)

Use Cases:
- Building and testing custom Cobalt Strike beacon loaders with reduced static signatures
- Evaluating EDR user-mode hooking resilience against indirect syscalls and unhooking
- Comparing execution techniques (APC vs callback execution) for stability/detection
- Generating Artifact Kit-compatible droppers for controlled red team operations
- Researching defensive detections for ETW tampering, PPID spoofing, and loader behaviors
