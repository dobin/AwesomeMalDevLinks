Title:
HookChain: A new perspective for Bypassing EDR Solutions

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- HookChain is a Windows user-mode evasion technique/toolchain that combines multiple well-known primitives to bypass EDR telemetry focused on `ntdll.dll` syscall stubs.  
- It redirects execution flow by using IAT hooking to intercept Win32/NT API usage, then performs dynamic System Service Number (SSN) resolution and executes indirect system calls.  
- The key idea is to avoid the common EDR hook points in `ntdll.dll` by shifting where and how syscalls are invoked, without requiring source-code changes in the target application/malware.  
- The repo includes code (C + assembly) plus a whitepaper (PDF) and links to public talks (DEFCON 32, Sector/BlackHat Toronto, MindTheSec).  
- It is primarily useful for red teams, pentesters, and offensive security researchers evaluating EDR coverage and designing user-mode evasion tradecraft; it is also relevant for blue teams to understand and detect non-`ntdll`-centric syscall paths.  

Technical Focus:
- Import Address Table (IAT) hooking
- Dynamic syscall number (SSN) resolution
- Indirect system calls (syscall invocation without standard `ntdll` stubs)
- Windows user-mode API interception and control-flow redirection
- EDR user-mode hooking assumptions and bypass strategies

Use Cases:
- Building/validating EDR bypass PoCs that avoid `ntdll.dll` hooks
- Executing sensitive actions (e.g., process access, memory operations) with reduced user-mode telemetry
- Researching detection gaps between Win32 APIs, `ntdll`, and syscall dispatch
- Developing alternative syscall invocation frameworks for implants/loaders
- Creating defensive detections for IAT tampering and anomalous syscall patterns
