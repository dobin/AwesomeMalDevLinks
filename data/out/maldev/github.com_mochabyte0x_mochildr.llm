Title:
MochiLdr (Reflective x64 Loader written in C/ASM)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- MochiLdr is a Windows x64 reflective loader that maps and executes a DLL from memory without relying on the normal OS loader path.  
- It targets stealthier in-memory execution by being CRT-free, position-independent, and by erasing the DOS header after allocating new memory.  
- The project includes custom implementations of GetProcAddress and GetModuleHandle, plus API hashing (Jenkins one-at-a-time) to reduce obvious imports/strings.  
- It supports TLS callbacks and registers exception handlers via RtlAddFunctionTable, improving compatibility with modern PE features and x64 unwind metadata.  
- The repo intentionally does not include an injector; users are expected to pair it with an external injector (e.g., KaynLdr’s) or write their own.  
- Useful primarily for red team operators, pentesters, and malware developers researching reflective loading tradecraft and PE manual mapping.

Technical Focus:
- Reflective DLL loading / manual PE mapping (x64)
- Position-independent code (PIC) and CRT-free payloads
- API hashing (Jenkins OAAT) and custom export resolution
- TLS callback handling during manual load
- x64 exception handling / unwind registration (RtlAddFunctionTable)
- Direct/low-level memory management via NTDLL syscalls

Use Cases:
- Building custom in-memory loaders for red team payload execution
- Researching/benchmarking reflective loading implementations (vs. KaynLdr/BokuLoader)
- Developing stealthier loaders by minimizing imports and removing PE artifacts (e.g., DOS header)
- Testing EDR detection logic around manual mapping, TLS execution, and unwind registration
