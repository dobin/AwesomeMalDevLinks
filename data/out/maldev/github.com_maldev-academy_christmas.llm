Title:
Maldev-Academy Christmas (multi-process staged process injection PoC)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository is a Windows process-injection proof-of-concept inspired by a technique mentioned by Hexacorn, implemented as a multi-process “assembly line” where each child process performs one injection step.  
- The injector creates a target process, then uses subsequent child processes to allocate memory, change protections to RWX, write the payload in 1024-byte chunks (spawning a new process per chunk), and finally execute it.  
- Payload material is RC4-encrypted (example: Havoc Demon), with a companion tool (`ChristmasPayloadEnc.exe`) to encrypt and pad the payload to a 1024-byte multiple to fit the write logic.  
- The design emphasizes distributing suspicious actions across many short-lived processes and passing state via command-line arguments while inheriting the target process handle.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers, malware developers, and security researchers studying EDR evasion tradeoffs and process-creation telemetry (the README includes a demo claiming MDE bypass with Havoc Demon).  

Technical Focus:
- Multi-process staged injection workflow (process-per-step)
- Handle inheritance across child processes
- Remote memory allocation / protection changes / remote writes
- Chunked payload writing (1024-byte segments)
- RC4 payload encryption and padding
- Command-line IPC/state passing between processes

Use Cases:
- Researching how splitting injection primitives across processes affects EDR detection
- Building/experimenting with alternative process injection chains for lab testing
- Generating encrypted/padded payload blobs for controlled execution tests
- Developing detections around anomalous process trees + inherited handles + remote memory ops
