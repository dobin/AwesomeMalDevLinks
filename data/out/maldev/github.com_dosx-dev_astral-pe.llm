Title:
Astral-PE — Low-level PE header & entry-point mutator for native Windows binaries

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
Astral-PE is a post-build mutator for native Windows PE files (.exe/.dll/.sys) that rewrites PE structural metadata and lightly obfuscates the entry point without packing, encrypting, injecting, or performing runtime code obfuscation. It targets “static structure” indicators used by unpackers, YARA rules, and sandbox clustering by clearing or altering fields like timestamps, Rich header, section names, debug directories/PDB paths, data directories, and import/export naming. It can also remove unused TLS/load-config/relocations, patch DOS stub fields, and adjust flags/versions to reduce toolchain fingerprinting while keeping execution intact. The tool is positioned as a pipeline step to apply after (and optionally before/after) packers/protectors, including signed-binary considerations (e.g., overlay stripping only if signed). It’s useful for red teams, malware developers, and reverse-engineering challenge authors who want to disrupt static analysis heuristics and signature-based detection that relies on stable PE metadata. It’s interesting because it focuses on “surgical” PE compliance-safe mutations rather than traditional packing, aiming to break assumptions in automated tooling.

Technical Focus:
- PE/COFF header and Optional Header mutation (TimeDateStamp, checksum, flags, subsystem versions)
- Rich Header removal and toolchain fingerprint disruption
- Debug Directory/PDB path stripping and metadata sanitization
- Import table name mutation and export table fabrication
- Entry point (AddressOfEntryPoint) patching/shuffling
- Data directory cleanup and section permission/characteristics changes

Use Cases:
- Post-process packed/protected payloads to break static unpacker logic and YARA signatures
- Reduce toolchain and build-environment attribution (Rich header, timestamps, PDB paths)
- Disrupt sandbox clustering and heuristic PE classifiers relying on stable metadata
- Create “structurally weird” binaries for crackmes or RE training
- Integrate into CI/CD build pipelines before signing and distribution
