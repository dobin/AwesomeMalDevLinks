Title:
GhostStrike

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- GhostStrike is a Windows C++ red-team tool that executes a payload via process hollowing to obtain a stealthy reverse shell/C2 execution path.  
- It focuses on evasion by avoiding static imports (dynamic API resolution via hashing), obscuring payload material (Base64 + XOR + Windows Crypto API–derived keys), and complicating analysis (control-flow flattening).  
- The workflow in the README shows generating a Sliver implant, exposing a listener via ngrok, converting the implant to shellcode with Donut, and embedding it into the C++ project for injection.  
- The core technique is running encrypted shellcode inside a legitimate target process to blend execution and reduce straightforward signature-based detection.  
- It’s primarily useful for Red Teamers and offensive security researchers experimenting with Windows injection/evasion tradecraft and for Blue Teamers who want a compact sample to build detections around.

Technical Focus:
- Process hollowing on Windows
- Dynamic API resolution (hash-based)
- Shellcode obfuscation (Base64, XOR)
- Windows Cryptography APIs for key generation/encryption
- Control-flow flattening / code obfuscation
- Payload generation pipeline (Sliver C2, Donut)

Use Cases:
- Execute a C2 implant by hollowing a benign Windows process
- Test EDR/AV detection coverage for API-hashing and hollowing behaviors
- Build and validate defensive telemetry/detections for injection chains
- Research payload protection layers (encoding + encryption) in memory-injection tooling
