Title:
EPIC (Extensible Position Independent Code)

GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- EPIC is a single-binary toolkit that streamlines writing, compiling, and linking Windows x64 position-independent code (PIC) payloads/shellcode in C/C++.  
- It solves common shellcode development pain points: predictable compilation output, avoiding unintended dependencies/bloat from standard headers/libc, and producing small payloads via dead-code elimination.  
- The workflow separates compilation (`pic-compile`) from linking (`pic-link`) so developers can compile once and rapidly generate different payload variants by selecting modules at link time.  
- It provides a PIC-compatible minimal `libc` and Win32 headers, plus a loader template generator to quickly test payloads as a normal EXE.  
- A notable technique is its “global context” mechanism using a fixed preserved register (RBX) to emulate global RW state without changing memory permissions.  
- Useful primarily for malware developers and red team operators building modular implants and shellcode, and for researchers who want reproducible PIC builds and inspectable linker maps.

Technical Focus:
- Windows x64 PIC/shellcode build pipeline (GCC/LD/objcopy with custom linker scripts)
- Module-based linking and symbol availability checks (`MODULE`, `EXISTS`)
- Dead-code elimination via function sections and linker garbage collection + linker map inspection
- PIC-safe minimal libc and Win32 header strategy (avoiding MinGW header bloat)
- Register-based global context/state management (RBX preservation)
- Loader template generation for payload testing/debugging

Use Cases:
- Build modular Windows x64 shellcode payloads with selectable capabilities at link time
- Generate minimal `payload.bin` from a PE `.text` extraction for injection into custom loaders
- Rapidly test PIC payloads by compiling an embedded loader EXE
- Debug payload logic using “monolith” non-PIC builds with standard debugging aids
- Audit exactly what code lands in the final payload using generated linker maps
