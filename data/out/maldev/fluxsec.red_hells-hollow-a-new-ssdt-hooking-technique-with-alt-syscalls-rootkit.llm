Title:
Hells Hollow: A new SSDT Hooking technique (with Alt Syscalls / Rootkit)

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
This post describes a Windows kernel SSDT-hooking approach (“Hells Hollow”) that leverages Windows 11 “alt syscalls” to intercept system calls in a way that can evade or complicate common syscall-integrity checks. It focuses on how rootkits/EDR-like drivers can hook syscall dispatch by targeting alternate syscall paths rather than only the traditional SSDT flow defenders often validate. The write-up ties the technique to modern syscall evasion tradecraft (HellsGate-style direct syscalls) and the evolving Windows 11 syscall surface. It’s primarily useful for red team/offensive kernel developers and malware/rootkit authors exploring stealthy syscall interception, and for blue teams researching new kernel-level detection gaps. The key value is highlighting that “syscall integrity” assumptions can break when alternate syscall mechanisms exist and are not equivalently monitored.

Technical Focus:
- Windows kernel SSDT hooking and syscall dispatch internals
- Windows 11 alternate syscalls (“alt syscalls”) mechanics
- Rootkit-style kernel interception and stealth considerations
- Syscall integrity validation / anti-hooking assumptions
- EDR evasion tradecraft around direct/alternative syscalls

Use Cases:
- Developing or evaluating stealthy kernel syscall hooks for research
- Testing EDR/syscall-integrity products against non-standard syscall paths
- Building detections for anomalous syscall dispatch/alt-syscall usage
- Reverse engineering Windows 11 syscall mechanisms and hook points
