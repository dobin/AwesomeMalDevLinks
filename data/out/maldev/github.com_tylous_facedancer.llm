Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
FaceDancer is a Windows exploitation utility for generating hijackable, proxy-based DLLs that execute attacker-supplied shellcode while forwarding legitimate exported functions to the real DLL. It focuses on two workflows: recon (extracting exports and generating a .def file for proxying) and attack (building a proxy DLL and, for COM techniques, producing the required HKCU registry entries). The tool targets DLL search-order/weak-permission hijacks (e.g., writable AppData plugin directories) and COM-based system DLL image loading where processes query HKCU COM registrations before falling back to machine-wide entries. This enables low-privilege code execution/persistence by abusing trusted/native processes (including WindowsApps-packaged apps like new Outlook/Teams) without needing to write into protected install directories. FaceDancer explicitly does not implement EDR evasion; operators must provide their own “malicious DLL” payload that contains any desired stealth. It’s primarily useful for red teams and pentesters building reliable DLL proxy hijacks and COM hijack chains.

Technical Focus:
- DLL proxying via export forwarding using .def files
- DLL hijacking via weak directory permissions / search-order abuse
- COM hijacking / COM-based DLL load control via HKCU registry precedence
- Shellcode embedding by converting an input DLL payload
- Targeting WindowsApps-packaged applications (e.g., olk.exe, ms-teams.exe)

Use Cases:
- Generate a proxy DLL that preserves application stability while executing payload code
- Identify/export all functions from a target DLL to build correct forwarding stubs
- Achieve low-privilege persistence by planting writable-folder proxy DLLs (e.g., add-ins/plugins)
- Achieve low-privilege execution by registering user-level COM entries to redirect system DLL loads
- Build process-specific COM proxy triggers (only execute when a chosen process loads the COM DLL)
