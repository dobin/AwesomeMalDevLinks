LoudSunRun — Stack Spoofing with Synthetic Frames (namazso / SilentMoonWalk / VulcanRaven-inspired)

GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- LoudSunRun is a Windows x64 C/ASM proof-of-concept for call stack spoofing by constructing synthetic stack frames and spoofing return addresses.  
- It aims to make sensitive API/syscall execution appear to originate from benign-looking call stacks (e.g., thread start wrappers), complicating EDR/user-mode stack-walk based detections.  
- The implementation allocates stack arguments, generates fake frames, prepares (optionally indirect) syscalls via SSNs, and uses a `jmp rbx` trampoline to pivot execution into a `fixup` routine that restores registers/stack and returns to the original caller.  
- A parameter struct drives the spoofing (trampoline gadget address, original return address, per-frame stack sizes, desired “shown” return addresses, and optional syscall number).  
- Examples include spoofed `NtAllocateVirtualMemory`, `memcpy`, and `NtCreateThreadEx` to perform local shellcode injection/execution.  
- Useful for red teams, implant developers, and researchers evaluating or bypassing user-mode telemetry that relies on call stack integrity.

Technical Focus:
- Synthetic stack frame construction (stack spoofing / stack walking deception)
- Return address spoofing with trampoline gadgets (`jmp rbx`)
- Indirect syscalls using SSNs (Nt* invocation patterns)
- Windows x64 calling convention and stack argument layout
- Stack “cutoff” technique (pushing 0 to terminate stack walk)
- Fixup/epilogue logic to restore stack pointer and registers

Use Cases:
- EDR evasion research against user-mode call stack inspection
- Building stealthier syscall/API invocation wrappers in implants
- Testing detection logic for anomalous stack frames / ROP-like trampolines
- Demonstrating synthetic-frame techniques for training and PoC development
- Local process injection chains with spoofed call stacks
