Title:
The Elastic Container Project for Security Research

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This write-up explains how to quickly stand up a local, fully containerized Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Elastic Agent/Fleet Server) for security research using the open-source “Elastic Container Project.”  
- It addresses the friction of building a non-production Elastic environment when Elastic Cloud isn’t suitable (offline labs, constrained environments, repeatable testbeds).  
- The project uses Docker Compose plus a helper shell script to stage images, start/stop/destroy the stack, and bootstrap self-signed TLS between components and the browser.  
- It walks through enabling the Detection Engine and prebuilt detection rules, creating Fleet agent policies, and enrolling endpoints (with `--insecure` due to self-signed certs).  
- It also covers lab-focused endpoint configuration (e.g., “Detect” vs “Prevent,” optional memory sample collection settings) and validates telemetry/detections using the EICAR test file.  
- Useful for detection engineers, threat hunters, incident responders, and red teamers who need a reproducible telemetry + detection lab to test rules, malware behavior, and endpoint visibility.

Technical Focus:
- Docker Compose-based Elastic Stack deployment (local lab)
- Fleet Server / Elastic Agent enrollment and policy management
- TLS bootstrapping with self-signed certificates
- Kibana Detection Engine and Elastic prebuilt detection rules
- Endpoint protection mode tuning (Detect vs Prevent) and telemetry validation
- Memory protection sample collection settings for analysis

Use Cases:
- Build a repeatable Elastic Security lab for rule development and tuning
- Detonate malware/test files (e.g., EICAR) and inspect alerts + process trees in Kibana
- Validate endpoint telemetry pipelines (process/network events) before production rollout
- Prototype Fleet policies and integrations (Endpoint & Cloud Security, System, Windows/Sysmon)
- Offline/air-gapped staging of Elastic container images for lab environments
