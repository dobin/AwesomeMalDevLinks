Title:
T-1: Intelligent VM Detection with DTC

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- T-1 is a Windows-focused C++ shellcode loader that gates execution using a simple machine-learning–derived virtual machine (VM) detection heuristic.  
- It trains a Decision Tree Classifier (DTC) in Python (scikit-learn) using system telemetry—primarily “process count per user”—then ports the learned decision logic into C++ conditionals (`VmDetection.cxx`).  
- At runtime, the program enumerates processes/users (via snapshot-based APIs) to compute the feature and decides whether it is likely bare metal or virtualized.  
- If a VM is detected, it can self-delete; otherwise it proceeds to execute shellcode (including an “inlined” execution path).  
- This is useful for red teamers and malware researchers exploring sandbox/VM evasion tradeoffs and how to operationalize ML-derived rules without shipping an ML runtime.  
- It’s interesting as a minimal example of converting a trained model into static branching logic suitable for small loaders.

Technical Focus:
- VM/sandbox detection via behavioral host telemetry (processes-per-user)
- Decision Tree Classifier training and rule extraction (scikit-learn)
- Windows process/user enumeration via Toolhelp snapshots
- Shellcode loading/execution techniques (inlined execution)
- Self-deletion / on-disk artifact removal
- C++/Python pipeline for model-to-code translation

Use Cases:
- Add VM/sandbox gating to a loader before payload execution
- Experiment with ML-derived heuristics for environment classification
- Demonstrate “model export” into static C/C++ logic for OPSEC/size reasons
- Research detection opportunities around process enumeration + self-delete behaviors
- Build lab PoCs for comparing heuristic vs. ML-assisted evasion
