Title:
sRDI – Shellcode Reflective DLL Injection

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- sRDI is a toolchain for converting Windows DLLs into position-independent shellcode that performs Reflective DLL Injection (a self-contained in-memory PE loader + embedded DLL).  
- It solves the problem of executing a DLL purely from memory without using the normal Windows loader, enabling “fileless” style execution and custom injection workflows.  
- The loader implements key PE-loading behaviors such as section mapping with correct permissions, import resolution, TLS callback handling, and basic sanity checks.  
- The repo includes multiple front-ends (native EXE, C#/.NET, Python, PowerShell) to generate and/or run the produced shellcode, plus utilities to statically embed precompiled loader blobs.  
- It exposes flags for operational tradeoffs like wiping PE headers, clearing DLL memory post-execution, import obfuscation (randomization + optional delays), and passing the shellcode base to exports.  
- Useful primarily for red teams, pentesters, and malware developers building custom in-memory execution/injection chains; also valuable for defenders studying reflective loading tradecraft.

Technical Focus:
- Reflective DLL Injection / in-memory PE loading
- Position-independent code (PIC) shellcode generation
- PE parsing: sections, relocations, IAT/import resolution
- TLS callbacks and DllMain/export invocation
- Anti-analysis/OPSEC options (header wiping, import obfuscation, memory clearing)

Use Cases:
- Convert an existing DLL payload into shellcode for in-memory execution
- Build custom loaders/injectors in C/C#/PowerShell/Python for post-exploitation
- Embed a reflective loader blob into other tooling for staged execution
- Experiment with PE loader behaviors (TLS, permissions, import handling) for research
- Apply basic evasion tradeoffs (clear headers, obfuscate imports, self-clean patterns)
