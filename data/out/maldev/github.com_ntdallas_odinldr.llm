Title:
OdinLdr — Cobalt Strike Reflective Loader with Synthetic Stackframe

GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
OdinLdr is a custom reflective loader for Cobalt Strike Beacon and post-exploitation DLLs focused on evasion during in-memory loading and execution. It implements indirect syscalls for memory allocation/protection (e.g., NtAllocateVirtualMemory / NtProtectVirtualMemory) while crafting synthetic stack frames to make call stacks appear legitimate to EDR/user-mode hooks. The project also uses synthetic stack framing around LoadLibraryA and employs gadgets to read module headers in a way intended to reduce exposure to EAF (Export Address Filtering) style monitoring. This is primarily useful for red teams and malware developers who need stealthier in-memory execution paths than default loaders. It’s interesting because it combines reflective loading with stack spoofing and syscall indirection—common detection pressure points for modern EDRs.

Technical Focus:
- Reflective DLL loading for Cobalt Strike Beacon/postex
- Indirect syscalls (user-mode syscall invocation without direct API calls)
- Synthetic/spoofed stack frames (call stack manipulation)
- Virtual memory operations (NtAllocateVirtualMemory, NtProtectVirtualMemory)
- EAF-aware module header parsing via ROP/gadgets
- EDR evasion tradecraft around API hooking/call stack telemetry

Use Cases:
- Load and execute Beacon reflectively with reduced user-mode API visibility
- Execute post-exploitation modules in-memory while spoofing call stacks
- Research/testing of EDR detections for syscall patterns and stack integrity
- Developing alternative loaders for OPSEC-focused Cobalt Strike operations
