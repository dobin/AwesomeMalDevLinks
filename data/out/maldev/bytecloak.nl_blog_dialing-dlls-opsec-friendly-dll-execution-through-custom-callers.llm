Title:
Dialing DLLs: OPSEC-friendly DLL execution through custom callers

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post explains how to execute payload loader DLLs without using noisy LOLBINs like `rundll32.exe` or relying on DLL hijacking.  
- The core idea is to build small “caller” programs/scripts that load a DLL and invoke an exported trigger function, which is benign, common behavior and can reduce detection tied specifically to `rundll32`.  
- It covers native Windows callers using `LoadLibrary`/`GetProcAddress` (runtime loading) and compile-time linking via `.def`/`.lib` to populate the Import Address Table so the Windows loader resolves the DLL automatically.  
- It also shows .NET callers via `DllImport`, plus scripting-based callers in PowerShell, Python (`ctypes`), and VBA, including practical caveats like DLL search order and bitness matching.  
- The post highlights that callers can embed pre/post-execution logic (guardrails, sandbox checks, UI/social engineering) around an otherwise closed-source loader.  
- Useful primarily for red teams and pentesters focused on OPSEC and execution tradecraft; also relevant to defenders for understanding alternative DLL execution patterns beyond `rundll32`.

Technical Focus:
- Windows DLL loading and export invocation (`LoadLibrary`, `GetProcAddress`)
- Import Address Table (IAT) / compile-time linking with `.def` and `.lib`
- .NET P/Invoke (`DllImport`) as a DLL trigger mechanism
- Scripting-engine DLL invocation (PowerShell Add-Type, Python `ctypes`, VBA `Declare`)
- DLL search order and path resolution considerations
- OPSEC tradeoffs vs `rundll32.exe` and DLL hijacking

Use Cases:
- Execute a loader DLL without `rundll32.exe` to avoid simple LOLBIN-based detections
- Wrap DLL payload triggering inside a custom native or .NET “legit-looking” executable
- Trigger DLL exports from whitelisted scripting engines when unknown EXEs are blocked
- Add operational guardrails/sandbox checks before invoking a payload export
- Improve realism by exposing multiple exports and calling a plausible function name
