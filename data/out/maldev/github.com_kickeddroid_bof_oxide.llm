Title:
bof_oxide — Rust BOF (Beacon Object File) POC/Template for COFF loaders

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository is a proof-of-concept/template for writing Beacon Object Files (BOFs) in Rust that can be executed by common COFF loaders used in C2 frameworks like Sliver, Havoc, and Cobalt Strike.  
- It aims to reduce BOF “volatility,” improve debugging ergonomics, and provide better error handling compared to typical C BOF workflows.  
- The design keeps the standard C `go` entrypoint, but forwards Beacon API function pointers into a Rust `initialize()` function that constructs a Rust `Beacon` wrapper and calls user code (e.g., `rust_bof`).  
- It demonstrates argument parsing and output via Beacon APIs (e.g., `BeaconOutput`, `BeaconPrintf`) and shows example execution using the Coffee BOF runner and Sliver.  
- Useful for red teamers/pentesters and offensive tool developers who want Rust ergonomics while staying compatible with BOF/COFF execution constraints.  
- Interesting because it illustrates a practical C↔Rust FFI pattern for BOFs and highlights the realities/limitations of Rust in COFF-loaded, in-memory execution contexts.

Technical Focus:
- Beacon Object Files (BOF) and COFF object execution
- Cobalt Strike/Sliver/Havoc Beacon API interop
- C↔Rust FFI with function-pointer passing
- BOF entrypoint conventions (`go`) and loader compatibility
- Debugging/error-handling patterns for BOFs
- PE/COFF sections and symbol layout (objdump inspection)

Use Cases:
- Build Rust-based BOFs compatible with Cobalt Strike/Sliver/Havoc COFF loaders
- Prototype and test BOFs locally with Coffee or similar BOF runners
- Create safer wrappers around Beacon APIs (printing, formatting, argument handling)
- Study COFF object structure/symbols for loader troubleshooting and compatibility
