Title:
snapinject_rs — Process Snapshotting Shellcode Injection (Rust)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository is a Rust proof-of-concept implementing remote process injection using Windows process snapshotting, derived from ORCA000’s “snaploader.”  
- It creates a sacrificial process, takes a snapshot of that process, and injects shellcode into the snapshot-based execution context.  
- The project is intentionally minimal and does not include common evasion features like dynamic API resolution.  
- It can be built as a standalone EXE (replace the `SHELL_CODE` in `main.rs`) or consumed as a Rust library via a single `inject_shellcode(process_name, shellcode)` call.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers and security researchers exploring alternative injection primitives and how snapshot-based approaches behave under EDR telemetry.  
- Its value is as a readable reference implementation for snapshot-based injection workflows in Rust.

Technical Focus:
- Windows process injection (remote shellcode injection)
- Process snapshotting-based execution (snaploader-style technique)
- Sacrificial process creation and manipulation
- Rust FFI / Windows API interop patterns
- PoC tradeoffs (no dynamic API resolution / limited stealth)

Use Cases:
- Build and test snapshot-based injection PoCs in Rust
- Compare EDR detection/telemetry of snapshot injection vs classic techniques (e.g., WriteProcessMemory/CreateRemoteThread)
- Embed an injection primitive into a larger Rust offensive toolchain
- Research and prototype defensive detections for snapshotting/injection behavior
