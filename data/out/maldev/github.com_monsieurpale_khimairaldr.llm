Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
KhimairaLdr is a Windows evasive shellcode loader implemented as a DLL intended to be sideloaded by a dropped executable (example flow uses `java-rmi.exe` to load a renamed `jli.dll`). The DLL stages RC4-encrypted shellcode from a web server, decrypts it using `SystemFunction032`, and executes it via local injection using `Nt*` APIs with “threadless” execution (`jmp rcx`). It emphasizes stealth by avoiding static imports through CRC32 API hashing, using stacked strings, removing CRT, and stripping common loader APIs like `LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress`. It also includes anti-EDR measures such as `ntdll.dll` unhooking via indirect syscalls and WinINet cache cleaning to reduce disk artifacts. Persistence options include HKCU Run key and Startup folder LNK-based persistence. It’s primarily useful for red teams/pentesters building staged payload delivery with common evasion patterns and basic persistence.

Technical Focus:
- DLL sideloading / proxy DLL-style loader (`jli.dll` via `java-rmi.exe`)
- API hashing (CRC32) and import table minimization
- Indirect syscalls and `ntdll` unhooking
- WinINet staging + cache cleaning (artifact reduction)
- RC4 decryption via `SystemFunction032` (advapi32/crypt routine)
- Local shellcode injection and threadless execution

Use Cases:
- Build a staged shellcode loader that retrieves payloads over HTTP(S) and executes in-memory
- Test EDR detections around indirect syscalls, unhooking, and import-less loaders
- Simulate DLL sideloading tradecraft using a benign-looking host executable
- Establish simple user-level persistence via Run keys or Startup LNKs
- Evaluate forensic artifacts from WinINet usage and cache-cleaning behavior
