Title:
ApexLdr (DLL Payload Loader)

GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
ApexLdr is a Windows DLL-based shellcode loader written in C, designed to be executed via DLL sideloading (example target: `pythonw.exe` loading a fake `python310.dll`). It stages shellcode over HTTP/S and executes it using the Windows Threadpool API rather than creating a straightforward remote thread, aiming to reduce common behavioral detections. The project includes multiple evasion-oriented implementation details such as indirect syscalls (SysWhispers3 with randomized jumpers), DLL unhooking, API hashing, IAT camouflage, and delay via “API hammering.” It is CRT-independent to reduce dependencies and potentially simplify deployment/OPSEC. The repo documents basic build/usage and shows testing with Havoc C2 and Windows Defender. It’s primarily useful for red teamers, pentesters, and malware developers studying loader tradecraft and common EDR/AV friction points.

Technical Focus:
- DLL sideloading and export proxying
- Shellcode staging over HTTP/S
- Indirect syscalls (SysWhispers3, jumper_randomized)
- Threadpool-based execution (TP work items/timers)
- User-mode unhooking of ntdll / API unhooking
- API hashing, IAT camouflage, and execution delay techniques

Use Cases:
- Build a sideloadable DLL loader for initial execution via trusted binaries
- Stage and run C2 shellcode (e.g., Havoc) with less direct CreateThread-style behavior
- Experiment with syscall-based evasion vs. user-mode API hooking
- Research/benchmark defensive detections for threadpool execution and unhooking
- Adapt the loader to other sideload targets by changing the exported entrypoint and proxying exports
