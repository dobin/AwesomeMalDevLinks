Title:
Living-Off-the-Blindspot – Operating into EDRs’ blindspot

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post analyzes common EDR visibility mechanisms (kernel callbacks, usermode API hooking, memory scanning, ML detections, IoCs/IoAs) and proposes a strategy of “operating in blind spots” rather than bypassing single controls.  
- It argues Python on Windows is a practical blind spot because the signed, widely-used interpreter (python.exe/pythonw.exe) produces highly variable telemetry, and Python lacks strong native transparency for dynamically executed code (context around PEP-578).  
- The author demonstrates an operational approach using the official Python Windows Embeddable Package to run post-exploitation tasks with minimal installation footprint and favorable ML “goodware” signals (signature/ubiquity).  
- Techniques shown include in-memory importing of Python tooling via PEP-302 import hooks, selective on-disk dropping of required `.pyd` extensions, executing Cobalt Strike BOFs via shellcode injected into the Python process, and optional in-process C2 stager execution tunneled over SSH.  
- The work is primarily useful for red teams/pentesters building low-noise tradecraft on EDR-protected endpoints, and for defenders/EDR engineers to understand interpreter-driven telemetry gaps and detection opportunities.

Technical Focus:
- EDR telemetry/visibility limits (kernel callbacks, usermode hooks, memory scanning)
- Python Windows Embeddable Package and signed interpreter abuse
- PEP-302 import hooks for in-memory module loading (sys.meta_path)
- `.pyd` (LoadLibraryEx) extension loading tradeoffs
- BOF execution via COFFLoader/BOF2Shellcode and in-process shellcode injection (ctypes)
- SSH local port forwarding for C2 tunneling (Paramiko)

Use Cases:
- Run AD recon (e.g., BloodHound-Python) from a signed interpreter with reduced on-disk artifacts
- Execute credential dumping workflows (e.g., secretsdump, LSASS dumping via modified nanodump BOF) without a full agent
- Stage “agentless-first” post-exploitation with optional last-resort in-process C2
- Tunnel C2 traffic through SSH local port forwarding to blend network egress
- Evaluate/benchmark EDR detection coverage against interpreter-based tradecraft
