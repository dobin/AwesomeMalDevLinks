Title:
TrampoLatté (TrampoLatte) — AMSI & ETW bypass PoC using trampoline hooking

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- TrampoLatté is a Windows proof-of-concept that bypasses AMSI and ETW by trampoline-hooking key functions and altering their control flow.  
- For AMSI, it hooks `AmsiScanBuffer` and forces a clean result (e.g., `AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN`) by redirecting execution to a proxy that preserves context and returns a benign scan outcome.  
- For ETW, it hooks `EtwpEventWriteFull` and redirects execution to a minimal return stub (`ret` / `C3`), effectively suppressing event emission.  
- The repo demonstrates a 13-byte `jmp r10` style trampoline patching approach to detour execution without relying on higher-level frameworks.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers, offensive security researchers, and malware developers studying user-mode telemetry suppression and inline hooking tradecraft.  
- The author notes it is not OPSEC-safe and is intended as a learning PoC rather than a production-ready bypass.

Technical Focus:
- Trampoline / inline hooking (detours) in user-mode
- AMSI bypass via `AmsiScanBuffer` result manipulation
- ETW suppression via `EtwpEventWriteFull` short-circuiting
- Control-flow redirection with custom stubs (C + small ASM)
- Context saving/restoring around hooks
- .NET runtime ETW consumer-based validation/testing

Use Cases:
- Bypassing AMSI scanning for in-memory script/assembly execution in a lab
- Suppressing ETW-based telemetry during .NET tradecraft testing (e.g., C2 execute-assembly)
- Studying and prototyping trampoline hook implementations and patch sizes
- Building detections around inline patching of AMSI/ETW-related exports
