Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
CTFPacker is a cross-platform (Linux/Windows) shellcode packer/loader generator intended for CTFs and pentest/red team exams where basic AV evasion is needed. It produces Windows EXE or DLL loaders that either embed shellcode (stageless) or download it over HTTP (staged). The generated loader combines multiple common evasion primitives such as indirect syscalls (SysWhispers-style), API hashing, custom module/API resolution, and NTDLL unhooking via the KnownDlls technique. Payloads can be AES-128-CBC encrypted and the loader can be “scrambled” to introduce polymorphic-like variation. Execution uses an injection technique (EarlyBird APC injection) and supports optional Authenticode signing via a provided PFX. It’s primarily useful for red teamers/pentesters and CTF players who want a repeatable way to wrap shellcode into a loader without hand-assembling these components.

Technical Focus:
- Indirect syscalls (SysWhispers-derived stubs, NASM-compatible)
- API hashing + custom GetProcAddress/GetModuleHandle implementations
- NTDLL unhooking via KnownDlls mapping
- AES-128-CBC payload encryption/decryption
- EarlyBird APC injection
- Staged (HTTP download via WinHTTP) vs stageless payload delivery; EXE/DLL output and signing

Use Cases:
- Generate a basic AV-evasive Windows shellcode loader for CTFs/exams
- Produce staged loaders that fetch shellcode from an operator-controlled HTTP server
- Produce stageless loaders with encrypted embedded payloads to reduce static signatures
- Create DLL loaders callable via `rundll32` (exported `ctf` function)
- Rapidly iterate loader variants using scrambling/polymorphism and optional signing
