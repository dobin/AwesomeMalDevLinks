Title:
RflDllOb (Bambini / Next Gen) — Reflective DLL Injection Made Bella

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository contains an R&D implementation of reflective DLL loading plus a custom injector, with two variants: “Bambini” (baseline) and “Next Gen” (evasion-focused).  
- It targets common detection points in reflective loaders (static signatures, userland hooks, and in-memory scanners) by modifying how the loader code executes and how the mapped image appears in memory.  
- Next Gen introduces “YOLO” (encrypt/decrypt and discard the ReflectiveLoader after first use), indirect syscalls to reduce exposure to user-mode API hooks, and “SWAPPALA” to swap a private malicious mapping with a legitimate on-disk DLL mapping at the same address.  
- It also implements a custom sleep/masking approach (“SLE(A)PING”) using timer worker threads and suspended threads with crafted contexts, plus timer callback spoofing to make the sleep orchestration less suspicious.  
- Useful primarily for red team operators, pentesters, and malware researchers studying reflective loading tradecraft and memory-evasion techniques; also valuable for blue teams to understand what to hunt for in memory and timer/thread artifacts.

Technical Focus:
- Reflective DLL loading (PIC loader, PE parsing, relocation/import resolution)
- Indirect syscalls / SSN enumeration (FreshyCalls, SysWhispers-style approaches)
- Loader self-protection (encrypt/decrypt loader, discard after use — “YOLO”)
- Memory evasion against in-memory scanners (private vs image-backed mappings, swapping)
- Sleep masking via timers/worker threads (SLE(A)PING) and timer callback spoofing
- Handle/section manipulation (ZwClose interference, section/view mapping mechanics)

Use Cases:
- Build and study a reflective DLL + dedicated injector workflow
- Prototype userland-hook bypass via indirect syscalls during loading
- Experiment with in-memory scanner evasion by mapping/swap techniques (SWAPPALA)
- Implement sleep masking that avoids common Ekko limitations (argument count/stack sharing)
- Develop detections around suspicious timer usage, thread context crafting, and mapping swaps
