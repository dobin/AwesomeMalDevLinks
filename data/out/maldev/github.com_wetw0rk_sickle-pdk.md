# Sickle - Payload Development Kit

[Permalink: Sickle - Payload Development Kit](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk#sickle---payload-development-kit)

[![alt text](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/raw/master/docs/logo/panda_logo.png)](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/blob/master/docs/logo/panda_logo.png)

Sickle is a tool I originally developed to help me be more effective, in both developing and understanding shellcode. However, throughout the course of its development and usage It has evolved into a payload development kit. Although current modules are mostly aimed towards assembly, this tool is not limited to shellcode.

Currently sickle can assist in the following.

- Converting assembly instructions to machine code (opcodes)
- Executing bytecode, including generated payloads
- Formatting opcodes for a target language
- Bad character identification
- Linear disassembly
- Diffing

## Shellcode Generation

[Permalink: Shellcode Generation](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk#shellcode-generation)

Sickle supports shellcode generation via the [Keystone Engine](https://www.keystone-engine.org/). Due to this being a newly added feature, payload support is limited. However, the goal is to add a basic reverse shell for each architecture and platform.

[![alt text](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/raw/master/docs/screenshots/generation.gif)](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/blob/master/docs/screenshots/generation.gif)[![alt text](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/raw/master/docs/screenshots/generation.gif)](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/blob/master/docs/screenshots/generation.gif)[Open alt text in new window](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/blob/master/docs/screenshots/generation.gif)

## Diffing

[Permalink: Diffing](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk#diffing)

Sickle includes a "diffing" module initially designed for analyzing shellcode stubs. The original "asm" mode performs linear disassembly diffs at both the assembly language and opcode levels separately.

[![alt text](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/raw/master/docs/screenshots/diff_shellcode.png)](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/blob/master/docs/screenshots/diff_shellcode.png)

In addition, Sickle offers various modes for performing diffs, making it useful beyond shellcode development.

[![alt text](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/raw/master/docs/screenshots/hexdump_diff.png)](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/blob/master/docs/screenshots/hexdump_diff.png)

## Shellcode Execution

[Permalink: Shellcode Execution](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk#shellcode-execution)

One common task you may often perform is testing your shellcode. This process typically involves the following steps:

1. Compile the assembly language code.
2. Extract the shellcode and format it appropriately for your chosen wrapper.
3. Compile the wrapper.
4. Execute the wrapper.

Although these steps may seem minor, they can become time-consuming when done repeatedly. Sickle simplifies the process by automatically wrapping shellcode for quick testing, and the "run" module currently supports both Windows and Unix systems.

[![alt text](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/raw/master/docs/screenshots/r.png)](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/blob/master/docs/screenshots/r.png)

## Disassembly

[Permalink: Disassembly](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk#disassembly)

Sickle can also convert a binary file into extracted opcodes (shellcode) and then translate those into machine instructions (assembly). Note that this process only works with raw binary files and currently performs disassembly in a linear fashion via [Capstone](https://www.capstone-engine.org/).

[![alt text](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/raw/master/docs/screenshots/disassemble.png)](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/blob/master/docs/screenshots/disassemble.png)

In the example shown above the "disassemble" module disassembles a reverse shell designed by Stephen Fewer to assembly.

## Shellcode Extraction

[Permalink: Shellcode Extraction](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk#shellcode-extraction)

Shellcode extraction was the first module, or rather, the core functionality for Sickle, as opcodes are interpreted differently depending on the wrapper used. JavaScript, for example, does not store and interpret shellcode in the same way as a C program would.

[![alt text](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/raw/master/docs/gifs/format.gif)](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/blob/master/docs/gifs/format.gif)[![alt text](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/raw/master/docs/gifs/format.gif)](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/blob/master/docs/gifs/format.gif)[Open alt text in new window](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/blob/master/docs/gifs/format.gif)

Perhaps the biggest inspiration for this was `msfvenom`.

## Bad Character Identification

[Permalink: Bad Character Identification](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk#bad-character-identification)

Although less common in 64-bit exploits, there may be instances where an exploit restricts the use of certain characters. This is where the "pinpoint" module excels, as it directly identifies and highlights the assembly instructions responsible for the identified bad character(s).

[![alt text](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/raw/master/docs/gifs/pinpoint.gif)](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/blob/master/docs/gifs/pinpoint.gif)[![alt text](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/raw/master/docs/gifs/pinpoint.gif)](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/blob/master/docs/gifs/pinpoint.gif)[Open alt text in new window](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk/blob/master/docs/gifs/pinpoint.gif)

# Module Based Design

[Permalink: Module Based Design](https://github.com/wetw0rk/sickle-pdk#module-based-design)

Originally, this tool started as a single large script. However, as it evolved, I found myself needing to re-learn the code with each update. To address this, Sickle now follows a modular approach, allowing for new functionality to be added with minimal time spent re-learning the tool’s design.

```
$ sickle-pdk -m run -i

Usage information for run

              Name: Shellcode Runner
            Module: run
      Architecture: Multi
          Platform: Multi
              Ring: 3

Author(s):
    wetw0rk

Tested against:
    Linux
    Windows

Module Description:

  Executes bytecode from a binary file (-r) or a payload module (-p) under the context
  of the currently running operating system and architecture. Meaning if you are
  running on AARCH64 bytecode will be interpreted as such and if you're on x64 it will
  interpret it as x64 respectively.

Example:

  /usr/local/bin/sickle-pdk -m run -r shellcode
```

This approach also includes documentation for shellcode stubs.

```
$ sickle-pdk -p windows/x64/egghunter -i

Usage information for windows/x64/egghunter

              Name: Windows (x64) Hell's Gate based Egghunter
            Module: windows/x64/egghunter
      Architecture: x64
          Platform: windows
              Ring: 3

Author(s):
    hvictor

Tested against:
    Windows 11 (10.0.26100 N/A Build 26100)

Argument Information:

  Name          Description           Optional
  ----          -----------           --------
  TAG           Egg (provide 4 bytes)      yes

Module Description:

  This egghunter iterates virtual memory addresses and before searching for the egg, it
  performs a NtProtectVirtualMemory system call. This system call is similar to
  VirtualProtect, and is parameterized to set the memory to be scanned to READ, WRITE,
  EXECUTE. This way, when the egg is found, the shellcode after it is guaranteed to be
  executable.

Example:

  /usr/local/bin/sickle-pdk -p windows/x64/egghunter TAG=w00t
```
