Title:
SHELLSILO — C-to-syscall assembly and shellcode translator

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- SHELLSILO is a Python tool that parses a constrained C-like syntax and translates it into Windows syscall-focused assembly (NASM or MASM) and corresponding shellcode/binaries.  
- It aims to reduce the manual effort of writing low-level shellcode by handling structure definitions/usage, variable assignments, control flow (if/while), and embedding strings/UNICODE_STRING initialization.  
- The tool resolves syscall numbers by mapping the host Windows build/model (queried via PEB inspection) to a bundled syscall table derived from j00ru’s syscall listings, and only looks up syscalls actually used in the input code.  
- The repo includes practical examples (e.g., `ntwrt.c`) demonstrating direct-syscall process injection flow: enumerate/find a target process, open it, allocate memory, write a payload buffer, and spawn a remote thread via `NtCreateThreadEx`.  
- Useful for red teamers, exploit devs, and malware researchers building direct-syscall payloads or prototyping shellcode without writing all assembly by hand.  
- Interesting because it combines a higher-level authoring experience with build-aware syscall resolution and can generate binaries directly, supporting x64 and multiple assembler syntaxes.

Technical Focus:
- Windows direct syscalls (NTAPI) and syscall number resolution by OS build
- Parsing/compiling C-like syntax into assembly and shellcode
- PEB-based environment/build identification
- UNICODE_STRING and string embedding for shellcode
- NASM/MASM x64 assembly generation
- Process injection primitives (alloc/write/remote thread)

Use Cases:
- Rapid prototyping of Windows x64 direct-syscall shellcode
- Generating syscall-based process injection stubs (NtOpenProcess/NtAllocateVirtualMemory/NtWriteVirtualMemory/NtCreateThreadEx)
- Building payloads that avoid Win32 API imports by using NT syscalls
- Creating reusable shellcode templates with structured data and Unicode handling
- Producing NASM/MASM-compatible assembly for further manual tuning
