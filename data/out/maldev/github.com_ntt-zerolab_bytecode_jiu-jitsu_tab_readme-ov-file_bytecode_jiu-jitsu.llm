Title:
Bytecode Jiu-Jitsu (Choking Interpreters to Force Execution of Malicious Bytecode) – PoC Tools

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository contains proof-of-concept tooling from NTT ZeroLab’s Black Hat USA 2024 briefing on “Bytecode Jiu-Jitsu,” a technique for coercing language interpreters into executing attacker-controlled bytecode.  
- It addresses the problem of reliably crafting and injecting malicious bytecode by reverse-engineering interpreter internals and extracting the necessary metadata (e.g., symbol tables) from real targets.  
- The toolchain is organized as a workflow: Tracer-BJJ collects runtime traces, STAGER-BJJ derives interpreter internal structures, Extractor-BJJ pulls bytecode and symbol tables, and Injector-BJJ performs the final injection.  
- The focus is on interpreter-aware manipulation rather than generic shellcode injection, emphasizing how bytecode formats and VM/runtime structures can be abused.  
- It is primarily useful for red teams, exploit developers, and security researchers studying interpreter internals and bytecode-level tradecraft; it also provides defenders insight into a less-monitored execution layer.  
- It’s interesting because it operationalizes a repeatable pipeline for bytecode injection that depends on understanding and leveraging interpreter implementation details.

Technical Focus:
- Interpreter/VM internal structure discovery via tracing
- Bytecode extraction and reconstruction (including symbol tables/metadata)
- Bytecode injection pipeline (trace → structure → extract → inject)
- Reverse engineering of language runtimes/interpreters
- PoC tooling for Black Hat research reproduction

Use Cases:
- Build a target-specific bytecode injection workflow against a chosen interpreter
- Extract and analyze bytecode/symbol metadata from a running interpreter instance
- Reproduce and validate “Bytecode Jiu-Jitsu” research claims in a lab
- Develop detections by understanding required artifacts/steps (tracing, metadata access, injection behavior)
- Train red/blue teams on interpreter-layer attack surfaces
