Title:
Kong Loader — JIT Instruction Decryption Shellcode Loader (“rolling” per-instruction decryption)

GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
Kong Loader is a Windows shellcode loader that uses Just-In-Time (JIT) per-instruction decryption so only the currently executing instruction is ever present in decrypted form in memory. It targets EDR memory-scanning detections that can catch traditional shellcode or even “sleep-masked” payloads during their decrypted execution windows. The loader disassembles/decrypts one instruction at a time, executes it, then re-encrypts it, trading significant performance and debuggability for reduced in-memory visibility. The project documents practical caveats (self-modifying shellcode issues, extreme slowness, no multithreading) and acknowledges the loader’s native stub is currently signatureable. It includes a YARA rule to detect the loader’s static native code and outlines future work like basic-block decryption and polymorphism. Useful primarily for red teamers/malware researchers exploring advanced in-memory evasion concepts, and for blue teamers studying detection opportunities around such loaders.

Technical Focus:
- Per-instruction JIT decryption / rolling shellcode decryption
- In-memory evasion vs EDR memory scanning
- Shellcode loading/execution on Windows (x64)
- Disassembly-driven execution (Zydis)
- Detection engineering (YARA signatures)
- PIC/position-independent first-stage constraints

Use Cases:
- Build tiny first-stage payloads that minimize decrypted memory footprint during execution
- Research/benchmark EDR memory scanning limits against per-instruction visibility
- Develop and test detections (YARA/static signatures, behavioral heuristics) for JIT-decrypting loaders
- Explore tradeoffs of instruction-level emulation/decryption vs sleep-masking approaches
