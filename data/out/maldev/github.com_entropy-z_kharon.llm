Title:
Kharon v0.1 (AdaptixC2 Agent & HTTP Listener Extender)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
Kharon is a custom agent for AdaptixC2 designed to emphasize evasion, capability, and malleability. It is implemented as fully position-independent code (PIC) and explicitly avoids using a reflective loader. The project includes multiple stealth features such as sleep obfuscation, heap obfuscation during sleep, stack spoofing combined with indirect syscalls, and built-in AMSI/ETW bypasses. It also provides a “BOF API proxy” to execute Beacon Object Files with spoofed/indirect API usage, and implements a sizable subset of the Cobalt Strike Beacon API for compatibility. The repo ships both the agent extender and an HTTP listener extender, intended to be integrated into AdaptixServer via Go workspaces and built as extenders. It’s primarily useful for red teams/pentesters building AdaptixC2 operations and for defenders studying modern in-memory tradecraft patterns.

Technical Focus:
- Position-independent (PIC) in-memory agent design without reflective loading
- Sleep/heap obfuscation techniques
- Stack spoofing and indirect syscalls
- AMSI and ETW bypass methods
- Beacon Object File (BOF) execution via API proxying
- C2 integration via AdaptixC2 extenders (agent + HTTP listener)

Use Cases:
- Deploying an evasive AdaptixC2 implant with reduced user-mode telemetry
- Running BOFs while proxying sensitive Win32/NT APIs to alter call patterns
- Testing EDR detections around sleep masking, stack spoofing, and syscall indirection
- Extending AdaptixC2 with custom agent/listener components and module ecosystems
- Researching Beacon API re-implementations and BOF interoperability
