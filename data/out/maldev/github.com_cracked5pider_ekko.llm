Title:
Ekko — Sleep Obfuscation via CreateTimerQueueTimer

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Ekko is a C proof-of-concept implementing a Windows “sleep obfuscation” technique using the Win32 `CreateTimerQueueTimer` API.  
- It aims to reduce detection during beacon/implant sleep by avoiding straightforward `Sleep()` patterns and leveraging timer-queue callbacks to manage delayed execution.  
- The repo is positioned as a minimal reference implementation inspired by techniques observed in MDSec’s Nighthawk and research credited to Peter Winter-Smith and Austin Hudson’s write-up.  
- The author explicitly notes the implementation has known flaws and warns against copy/pasting into real implants without understanding and fixing issues.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers, implant developers, and defenders studying modern evasion tradecraft and how timer-based sleeping can appear in telemetry.  
- Interesting because it demonstrates a commonly discussed but often poorly implemented evasion primitive in a small, auditable codebase.

Technical Focus:
- Win32 Timer Queue Timers (`CreateTimerQueueTimer`)
- Sleep obfuscation / delayed execution patterns
- Callback-based execution flow
- EDR/behavioral detection evasion primitives
- Windows user-mode tradecraft (implant sleep strategy)

Use Cases:
- Implementing or experimenting with alternative sleep mechanisms in Windows implants (research/PoC)
- Building detections for timer-queue-based delayed execution and anomalous callback behavior
- Training and code review exercises on common pitfalls in sleep obfuscation implementations
- Comparing `Sleep()` vs timer/callback approaches in endpoint telemetry
