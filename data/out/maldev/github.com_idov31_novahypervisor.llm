Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- NovaHypervisor is an early-stage defensive, host-based x64 Intel hypervisor for Windows 10+ intended to mitigate kernel-mode attacks, including BYOVD-style abuse.  
- It aims to protect security products (AV/EDR) and critical kernel memory structures by preventing unauthorized reads/writes/executes to specified kernel memory addresses.  
- The project provides a kernel driver (hypervisor) plus a user-mode client (NovaClient) to add/remove protected addresses and define access permissions (r/w/x).  
- It is designed to coexist with Hyper-V and relies on VT-x and virtualized IOMMU support.  
- Logging is implemented via WPP tracing to work from VMX root mode, with guidance for ETL collection and kernel debugging setup.  
- It explicitly avoids supporting execution-hook features (inline hook + EPT hook combos) to reduce offensive abuse potential, positioning it as an educational defensive reference.

Technical Focus:
- Intel VT-x virtualization (VMX root/non-root)
- Host-based hypervisor on Windows with Hyper-V compatibility
- Kernel memory access control (read/write/execute restrictions)
- Defensive mitigation of BYOVD and kernel tampering
- Windows kernel driver development (WDK, service loading)
- WPP software tracing / ETW-style logging from kernel/VMX context

Use Cases:
- Protecting specific kernel memory regions from unauthorized access during incident response or hardening experiments
- Researching defensive virtualization approaches against kernel-mode malware and BYOVD chains
- Building/validating hypervisor-based memory access monitoring concepts in a lab
- Developing detections/telemetry pipelines using WPP/ETL logs for hypervisor events
- Educational reference for Windows hypervisor + driver architecture and debugging workflows
