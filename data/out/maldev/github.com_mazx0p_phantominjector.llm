Title:
PhantomInjector – Advanced In-Memory PowerShell Process Injection Framework

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- PhantomInjector is a PowerShell-based framework for executing shellcode in remote processes using multiple in-memory injection techniques with built-in evasion options.  
- It targets common defensive controls by offering AMSI bypass (patching `AmsiScanBuffer`), ETW bypass (hooking/patching `EtwEventWrite`), and NTDLL unhooking by restoring clean bytes from disk.  
- Supported injection methods include APC injection (Early Bird/`QueueUserAPC`), thread hijacking (`Get/SetThreadContext`), classic remote thread injection, process ghosting (TxF + section/process creation), and module stomping v2 (tail-of-image overwrite with thread-context hijack).  
- The tool can optionally use direct syscalls via in-memory assembly stubs to reduce user-mode API telemetry and bypass hooks.  
- It includes OPSEC-oriented checks (anti-debug, sandbox detection) and supports local or remote payload retrieval.  
- Useful primarily for red teams and penetration testers to prototype and compare injection/evasion tradeoffs; also relevant to blue teams for understanding detection points and Sysmon rule ideas.

Technical Focus:
- PowerShell in-memory shellcode loading and execution
- Process injection: APC, thread hijack, remote thread, module stomping, process ghosting
- AMSI bypass via `AmsiScanBuffer` patching
- ETW bypass via `EtwEventWrite` patching/hooking
- NTDLL unhooking (restoring clean `ntdll.dll` bytes)
- Direct syscalls (NTAPI stubs: `NtCreateThreadEx`, `NtAllocateVirtualMemory`, `NtQueueApcThread`, etc.)

Use Cases:
- Execute shellcode in a chosen target process (e.g., notepad) using different injection primitives
- Run payloads with reduced PowerShell/ETW/AMSI visibility during an engagement
- Compare WinAPI vs direct-syscall execution paths for telemetry differences
- Simulate advanced tradecraft (process ghosting/module stomping) for detection engineering validation
- Build/validate Sysmon/Sigma detections for memory protection changes, remote thread creation, and suspicious PowerShell command lines
