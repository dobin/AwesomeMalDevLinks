Title:
Syscalls vs Modern AV/EDR in 2025: The Myth, the Reality, and What Actually Matters

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- The post argues that direct/indirect Windows syscalls are no longer a reliable “EDR bypass” in 2025 and that the common offensive narrative around them is outdated.  
- It explains that modern AV/EDR products (e.g., Defender, CrowdStrike, SentinelOne) collect telemetry across user mode, kernel mode, memory, behavior correlation, and cloud analytics, focusing on outcomes rather than the API path used.  
- The author emphasizes that all meaningful actions still transition into the kernel (allocation, protection changes, thread creation, execution), so syscall stubs don’t remove visibility.  
- A major focus is continuous/event-triggered memory scanning and common detection triggers like RW→RX transitions, new executable pages, and thread start addresses in non-image/unbacked memory.  
- It highlights why “encrypted payloads” still get caught: code must decrypt to execute, and scanners can detect small decrypted windows plus behavioral context.  
- The takeaway for red teams is to prioritize behavior shaping (blending into legitimate flows, minimizing suspicious transitions/patterns) over syscall-centric tricks; for defenders, alerts are driven by anomalous execution and memory behavior, not syscall usage itself.

Technical Focus:
- Direct vs indirect syscalls and user-mode hook evasion limits
- Kernel telemetry and event visibility (process/thread/memory operations)
- Memory scanning and event-triggered inspection
- RW→RX transitions, executable page creation, unbacked/non-image memory execution
- Behavioral correlation (process ancestry, role-based anomalies, fleet rarity)
- Payload decryption windows and in-memory detection

Use Cases:
- Red team tradecraft tuning to reduce suspicious memory/execution patterns
- Threat hunting/detections around RW→RX, suspicious thread start addresses, and unbacked executable memory
- Evaluating syscall-loader PoCs against modern EDR telemetry models
- Training juniors on realistic Windows/EDR detection surfaces (behavior > API choice)
