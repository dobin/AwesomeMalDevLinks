Title:
Rust for Malware Development

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- A large Rust codebase of Windows-focused malware development and red team PoCs covering execution, injection, evasion, persistence, and C2-style components.  
- It consolidates many “maldev” building blocks (shellcode loaders, process manipulation, syscall techniques, API hooking/unhooking, and anti-analysis) into runnable, documented snippets and mini-projects.  
- Techniques include process ghosting/herpaderping/hollowing, PPID spoofing, thread hijacking variants, direct/indirect syscalls (e.g., Tartarus/Recycled Gate), AMSI bypasses, ETW/stack-trace evasion concepts (e.g., proxy DLL loads), and sleep obfuscation (Ekko).  
- It also includes encryption/obfuscation utilities for payloads and strings plus helper tooling (PEB offset finding, dynamic export resolution, EDR checker, WinHTTP/NtSockets downloaders).  
- Useful primarily for red teamers, malware researchers, and offensive tool developers learning or prototyping Windows tradecraft in Rust; secondarily useful for blue teams to understand technique implementations for detection engineering.  
- Interesting because it maps many modern Windows offensive patterns into Rust using windows-rs/NTAPI patterns and emphasizes modular PoCs that can be recombined.

Technical Focus:
- Windows process injection & execution (hollowing, ghosting, herpaderping, early-cascade, thread hijacking)
- NTAPI usage and direct/indirect/parallel syscalls; unhooking gates (Tartarus/Recycled)
- EDR/AV evasion primitives (AMSI bypass, anti-debugging, sleep obfuscation, proxy DLL load/ETW-related evasion)
- Dynamic API resolution via PEB/export parsing and hashing
- Payload encryption/obfuscation (AES/RC4/XOR, SystemFunction032/033, format-based shellcode obfuscation)
- Windows networking/IO for staging (WinHTTP, NtCreateFile/NtDeviceIoControlFile “NtSockets”, named pipes)

Use Cases:
- Build and test Rust-based shellcode loaders and injection chains on Windows
- Prototype syscall-based execution paths to reduce userland API hooking exposure
- Implement staging/downloading and IPC (WinHTTP, named pipes) in offensive implants
- Experiment with anti-analysis (anti-debug/anti-VM) and timing/sleep obfuscation
- Create lab PoCs for detection validation around process tampering and injection behaviors
- Study/port common maldev techniques into custom Rust tooling
