Title:
foliage (GitHub repository not accessible / 404)

Type:
GitHub Tool (unavailable)

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- The provided GitHub link returns a 404 page, so the repository content (README, code, releases) is not accessible from the extracted text.  
- As a result, the tool’s purpose, techniques, and intended audience cannot be reliably determined.  
- This commonly indicates the repo was deleted, made private, renamed, or the URL is incorrect.  
- If you can provide an updated link, a README snippet, or a file listing, I can produce a proper technical summary.

Technical Focus:
- Not determinable (repository content unavailable)
- GitHub repository availability/permissions
- URL/repo rename or deletion scenarios

Use Cases:
- Validate whether a security tool repo has been removed/privatized
- Triage broken references in research notes or toolchains
- Request/locate alternate mirrors or forks for unavailable repos
