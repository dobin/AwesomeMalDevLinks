# Dirty Vanity

[Permalink: Dirty Vanity](https://github.com/deepinstinct/Dirty-Vanity#dirty-vanity)

A POC for the new injection technique, abusing windows fork API to evade EDRs.

### Usage

[Permalink: Usage](https://github.com/deepinstinct/Dirty-Vanity#usage)

DirtyVanity.exe \[TARGET\_PID\_TO\_REFLECT\]

### Runtime steps

[Permalink: Runtime steps](https://github.com/deepinstinct/Dirty-Vanity#runtime-steps)

- Allocate and write shellcode to \[TARGET\_PID\_TO\_REFLECT\]
- Fork \[TARGET\_PID\_TO\_REFLECT\] to a new process
- Set the forked process's start address to the cloned shellcode

### Shellcode

[Permalink: Shellcode](https://github.com/deepinstinct/Dirty-Vanity#shellcode)

The reflected shellcode works with ntdll API. It is generated from the included generation project `shellcode_template`,
curtesy of [https://github.com/rainerzufalldererste/windows\_x64\_shellcode\_template](https://github.com/rainerzufalldererste/windows_x64_shellcode_template)

### Shellcode customization

[Permalink: Shellcode customization](https://github.com/deepinstinct/Dirty-Vanity#shellcode-customization)

To customize the shellcode with ease:

- Edit the `shellcode_template` function inside the `shellcode_template` project, according to the instructions in [https://github.com/rainerzufalldererste/windows\_x64\_shellcode\_template](https://github.com/rainerzufalldererste/windows_x64_shellcode_template)
- Compile it
- Crop the `shellcode_template` function bytes using your faivorite PE parsing tool (eg IDA)
- Those bytes are position independet shellcode. place them in `DirtyVanity.cpp`
- Execute DirtyVanity to watch them get Reflected
