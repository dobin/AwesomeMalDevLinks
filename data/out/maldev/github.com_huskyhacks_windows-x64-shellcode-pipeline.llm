Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
This repository provides a Dockerized, reproducible build pipeline for generating custom Windows x64 position-independent shellcode from C source code instead of hand-written assembly. It solves the common workflow pain of building PIC-compatible payloads, extracting the correct bytes from a compiled PE, and producing a final `.bin` shellcode blob (plus a C array output) in an automated way. The pipeline compiles a scaffolded PE, post-processes/cleans the generated assembly via Python tooling, and extracts the entrypoint-aligned `.text` bytes into raw shellcode. It includes a stack-alignment fix using Matt Graeber’s AlignRSP stub to avoid x64 calling convention/16-byte alignment issues. An example XOR encoder/decoder stub demonstrates how to ship encoded (polymorphic-style) payloads that decode at runtime, with guidance for implementing custom encoders. It’s primarily useful for red teamers, pentesters, and malware dev learners who want a consistent cross-compilation workflow and a practical template for API-resolving shellcode bootstraps (PEB walking, dynamic imports).

Technical Focus:
- Windows x64 position-independent code (PIC) shellcode generation
- Cross-compilation/build automation with Docker + Makefile (mingw-w64 toolchain)
- PE-to-shellcode extraction (entrypoint RVA, `.text` section parsing)
- PEB walking and dynamic API resolution (LoadLibraryA/GetProcAddress reconstruction)
- x64 stack alignment (AlignRSP stub, 16-byte boundary)
- Shellcode encoding/decoding stubs (XOR example, polymorphic pipeline hooks)

Use Cases:
- Build custom Windows x64 shellcode payloads from modular C code
- Create reproducible shellcode builds in CI/CD or isolated dev environments
- Prototype loader-style shellcode that resolves APIs dynamically via the PEB
- Generate encoded shellcode variants by swapping in custom encoder/decoder logic
- Produce `.bin` blobs and C-formatted byte arrays for integration into droppers/loaders
