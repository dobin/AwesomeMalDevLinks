Title:
Alternative Shellcode Execution Via Callbacks (AlternativeShellcodeExec)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository is a collection of Windows API “callback-based” execution techniques for running position-independent shellcode without relying on classic primitives like `CreateThread`.  
- It demonstrates many different APIs that accept function pointers (callbacks) and can be repurposed to transfer execution to attacker-controlled code after allocating/writing shellcode in memory.  
- The project is organized as many small C++ examples, each focusing on a specific callback-capable API (e.g., threadpool waits/timers, enumeration callbacks, fiber-related execution).  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers, pentesters, and malware developers exploring alternative in-process execution flows and how they may evade simplistic detections keyed on common injection/execution APIs.  
- It’s also valuable to blue teams as a reference set for building behavioral detections around unusual callback registration + RWX/RX memory patterns and suspicious control-flow transfers.  
- The breadth of APIs covered highlights how large the Windows callback surface is and why “block CreateRemoteThread/CreateThread” is not a sufficient defensive strategy.

Technical Focus:
- Windows callback function abuse for code execution
- Threadpool-based execution (waits/timers)
- Enumeration APIs as execution trampolines (GUI/GDI/locale/resource/cert callbacks)
- Fiber execution and context manipulation
- In-process shellcode staging (allocation, permissions, indirect invocation)

Use Cases:
- Build/compare alternative shellcode execution PoCs for Windows
- Develop EDR detection logic for callback registration followed by execution from non-module memory
- Red team tradecraft research to diversify execution chains beyond `CreateThread`
- Training material for Windows internals/control-flow and callback surfaces
- Test defensive coverage against indirect execution techniques
