Title:
Early Cascade Injection PoC (Cracked5pider)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository contains a proof-of-concept implementation of “Early Cascade Injection,” a Windows process-creation-time injection technique described by Outflank.  
- The PoC focuses on achieving stealthy code execution early in a target process’ lifetime by leveraging internals involved in Windows shims/AppCompat-style loading behavior.  
- It hardcodes internal offsets/pointers (notably `g_ShimsEnabled` and `g_pfnSE_DllLoaded`) rather than dynamically resolving them, making it version-specific and fragile across builds.  
- The author notes testing on Windows 10 build `10.0.22631.4317` and credits Outflank’s write-up plus related EDR preload research (MalwareTech).  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers, exploit devs, and security researchers studying early-process injection tradecraft and potential EDR blind spots during process initialization.  
- The key value is a minimal, readable codebase that operationalizes the blog-described technique for experimentation and detection engineering.

Technical Focus:
- Windows process creation internals and early-stage injection timing
- AppCompat/Shim engine internals (shim enablement and DLL-load callbacks)
- Hardcoded symbol/offset usage across Windows builds
- Stealthy user-mode injection tradeoffs vs. EDR visibility windows
- PoC implementation in C++ (with supporting build artifacts)

Use Cases:
- Reproducing and validating Outflank’s Early Cascade Injection technique in a lab
- Testing EDR/telemetry coverage during process initialization and shim-related loading
- Building detections around unusual shim-engine state changes or early DLL load callbacks
- Comparing early injection approaches (e.g., “EDR preload” concepts) against modern defenses
