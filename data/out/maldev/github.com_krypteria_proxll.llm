Title:
Proxll — Proxy DLL Template Generator (with windows.h conflict workaround)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Proxll is a C++ tool that generates proxy DLL templates to facilitate DLL proxying/hijacking scenarios without breaking the host application.  
- It automates creating forwarded exports and a wrapper for a chosen target export (or `DllMain`) so custom code can run and then call through to the real function to preserve expected behavior.  
- The repo also documents a common implementation pitfall: `windows.h` symbol conflicts when defining exported functions, and solves it by splitting code into a “core” file that includes `windows.h` and an “exports” file that avoids it.  
- The workflow uses ProcMon/API Monitor to identify DLL load opportunities, then `proxllGen.exe` generates a buildable template (including a `.def` file) compiled via MinGW.  
- Useful primarily for red teamers/pentesters and malware developers building reliable proxy DLLs; also relevant to defenders for understanding how proxying is implemented and why apps don’t crash when hijacked.

Technical Focus:
- DLL proxying / DLL search order hijacking mechanics
- Forwarded exports and `.def`-based export mapping
- LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress call-through wrappers
- One-time execution / re-entrancy blocking in exported stubs
- C++ build/ABI issues with `windows.h` symbol conflicts
- MinGW (x86_64-w64-mingw32) build pipeline for Windows DLLs

Use Cases:
- Generate a proxy DLL that executes a payload and then forwards to the legitimate DLL to avoid application crashes
- Rapidly scaffold export stubs/forwarders for a target system DLL (e.g., `version.dll`)
- Create reproducible templates for testing DLL hijack opportunities found with ProcMon
- Build lab PoCs demonstrating proxy DLL behavior and debugging via DebugView
