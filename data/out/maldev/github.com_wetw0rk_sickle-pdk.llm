Title:
Sickle – Payload Development Kit (sickle-pdk)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Sickle is a modular payload development kit focused on building, analyzing, formatting, and testing shellcode/bytecode across multiple architectures and platforms.  
- It streamlines common shellcode workflows by converting assembly to opcodes, extracting/formatting bytecode for many target languages, and providing a runner that auto-wraps and executes payloads on Windows and Unix.  
- The toolkit includes linear disassembly (Capstone), interactive assembly/disassembly and shellcode generation (Keystone), bad character identification with instruction-level pinpointing, and multiple diff modes for comparing shellcode stubs/binaries.  
- It ships with a growing library of payload modules (e.g., reverse shells, staged stagers, reflective PE/ELF loaders, egghunters, and some Windows kernel ring-0 primitives).  
- Useful primarily for red teamers, exploit developers, and malware researchers who need rapid iteration and validation of shellcode and small payload stubs.  
- Interesting because it combines “msfvenom-like” formatting/extraction with analysis (diff/disasm) and execution tooling in a single, extensible module-based framework.

Technical Focus:
- Assembly ↔ machine code conversion (Keystone)
- Linear disassembly and opcode extraction (Capstone)
- Shellcode execution via auto-generated wrappers (Windows/Unix)
- Bad character detection and instruction attribution (“pinpoint”)
- Bytecode/binary diffing (opcode + asm-level)
- Modular payload/stager framework (multi-arch, multi-platform)

Use Cases:
- Rapidly assemble and format shellcode for C/C#/PowerShell/JS/Python/etc. wrappers
- Test shellcode locally with minimal boilerplate using the runner module
- Identify which instructions introduce restricted bytes in exploit constraints
- Diff and analyze changes between shellcode stubs or packed/unpacked bytecode
- Generate and customize common payloads (reverse shells, stagers, reflective loaders)
- Extract opcodes from raw binaries and review linear disassembly for analysis
