Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- DllShimmer is a Go-based generator for creating proxy/backdoored Windows DLLs to “weaponize” DLL hijacking/sideloading.  
- It parses a target DLL’s export table to extract exported function names, ordinals, and forwarded exports, then generates C++ proxy boilerplate plus a matching `.def` file.  
- The goal is to preserve normal program behavior while allowing the operator to insert custom code into exported functions, without needing reverse engineering or function signature knowledge.  
- A key design point is producing a proxy whose Export Address Table (EAT) mirrors the original (including ordinals and forwarded exports), avoiding the suspicious “new EAT” patterns common in simpler proxy generators.  
- It supports dynamic forwarding via `LoadLibraryA()`/`GetProcAddress()` by default, and an optional static-linking mode that emits an import library (`.lib`) with tradeoffs in path control and debuggability.  
- Useful primarily for red teams, pentesters, and malware developers building DLL proxy payloads; also relevant to blue teams for understanding realistic proxy-DLL tradecraft and artifacts.

Technical Focus:
- PE export parsing (EAT, ordinals, forwarded exports)
- Proxy DLL generation (C++ stubs + `.def` export mapping)
- DLL hijacking / DLL sideloading tradecraft
- Dynamic API resolution (`LoadLibraryA`, `GetProcAddress`)
- Static vs dynamic linking behaviors in Windows loader
- Operational constraints (calling conventions, argument/register handling, current directory issues)

Use Cases:
- Generate a proxy DLL that preserves all exports while executing custom code on function calls
- Build DLL sideloading payloads for initial access or persistence in Windows applications
- Rapidly create “drop-in replacement” DLLs for testing hijackable search-order scenarios
- Reproduce and study export-table–matching techniques for detection engineering and forensics
