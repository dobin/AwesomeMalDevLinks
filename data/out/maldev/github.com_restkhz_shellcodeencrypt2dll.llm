ShellcodeEncrypt2DLL

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- ShellcodeEncrypt2DLL is a Python-based generator that produces a Windows DLL loader which decrypts and executes embedded shellcode at runtime.  
- It aims to reduce static AV detections by encrypting both the shellcode and suspicious API/function-name strings, and by resolving APIs dynamically.  
- The tool supports two build modes: “standalone” (AES key stored in the DLL for self-decryption) and “non-standalone” (key supplied at runtime, e.g., via rundll32 export argument) to hinder offline recovery if the DLL is captured.  
- It uses a C++ loader template compiled via mingw-w64 on Linux, with Python (pycryptodome) generating headers and encrypted blobs.  
- An optional patching step is included to tweak the produced DLL for specific AV products.  
- Useful primarily for red teams/pentesters and malware developers experimenting with encrypted payload loaders and DLL execution tradecraft (sideloading/hijacking/rundll32 execution).

Technical Focus:
- AES-CBC encryption of shellcode and strings
- Dynamic API resolution / string obfuscation
- DLL export-based execution via rundll32 (EPoint)
- Loader generation pipeline (Python → C++ template → mingw-w64 build)
- Standalone vs external-key decryption design
- Optional binary patching for AV-specific bypasses

Use Cases:
- Generate an encrypted DLL shellcode loader for controlled red team operations
- Test static detection resilience against AV/EDR with encrypted strings and payloads
- Build DLLs for sideloading/hijacking scenarios where an exported entrypoint is invoked
- Create “keyless-in-binary” loaders requiring an operator-supplied decryption key at runtime
- Rapidly iterate loader variants by modifying template/patch steps
