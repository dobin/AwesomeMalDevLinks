Title:
Remote DLL Injection with Timer-based Shellcode Execution

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
This repository demonstrates a Windows remote DLL injection workflow where an injector loads a DLL into a target process and the injected DLL executes shellcode via the Windows thread pool timer mechanism. It combines classic `CreateRemoteThread` + `LoadLibraryW` DLL injection with in-memory execution triggered by `CreateThreadpoolTimer`, aiming to run payload code on “legitimate” system-managed thread pool threads rather than a newly created suspicious thread. The code includes process enumeration/targeting, remote injection plumbing, and a timer callback that runs shellcode after configuring `TP_CALLBACK_ENVIRON`. This is primarily useful for red teamers, pentesters, and malware researchers studying alternative execution primitives and potential EDR detection gaps around thread pool–based execution. It’s interesting because it shifts execution to thread pool infrastructure (timers/callbacks), which can change telemetry patterns compared to straightforward remote thread shellcode execution.

Technical Focus:
- Remote DLL injection (`CreateRemoteThread`, `LoadLibraryW`)
- Windows Thread Pool Timers (`CreateThreadpoolTimer`)
- Timer callback–driven shellcode execution
- `TP_CALLBACK_ENVIRON` configuration
- Process enumeration and target selection
- In-memory payload execution in a remote process context

Use Cases:
- Evaluate EDR/AV visibility of thread pool timer–based execution vs. classic remote thread techniques
- Build and test alternative post-exploitation execution chains in Windows userland
- Research detection opportunities around thread pool objects, timer callbacks, and injected module behavior
- Training/demo code for understanding DLL injection and thread pool internals
