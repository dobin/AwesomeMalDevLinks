The most common way this happens is by placing your lookalike DLL higher up in the search order than the intended DLL, thereby getting your DLL selected first by the Windows library loader.</p><p>While mostly being a decisive technique, DLL hijacking has always had one <strong>huge</strong> disadvantage in the way that it executes our third-party code once loaded into the process. It's known as <strong>Loader Lock</strong>, and when our third-party code is run, it's subject to all its strict limitations. These include creating processes, doing network I/O, calling registry functions, creating graphical windows, loading additional libraries, and much more. Trying to do any of these things under Loader Lock may <strong>crash or hang</strong> the application.</p><p>Until now, only satisfactory (but needing something more), soon-to-break, or sometimes a tad over-engineered solutions for this problem have existed. <span style="font-weight:800">So today, we're doing 100% original research reverse engineering the Windows library loader to not just cleanly workaround Loader Lock but, in the end, disable it outright. Plus, coming up with some stable mitigation &amp; detection mechanisms defenders can use to help guard against DLL hijacking.</span></p><h2 id="about-dllmain">About DllMain<a aria-label="Anchor link for: about-dllmain" class="zola-anchor" href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/#about-dllmain">🔗</a></h2><p><code>DllMain</code> is a DLL's initialization function under Windows. Whenever a DLL is loaded, <code>DllMain</code> is called and the code inside it (e.g. our third-party code) is executed. <code>DllMain</code> is run under Loader Lock which, as previously mentioned, puts some limitations on what can be done safely from <code>Dllmain</code>.</p><div style="margin:auto;width:50%"><div style="text-align:center"><figure><a href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/library-load-dllmain-loader-lock-state-transitions.png" target="_blank"> <img src="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/library-load-dllmain-loader-lock-state-transitions.png"> </a></figure></div></div><p><strong>Specifically, Microsoft would just like to make us aware of <i><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-best-practices#general-best-practices" target="_blank">one minor caveat</a></i> about doing anything from <code>DllMain</code>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>You should never perform the following tasks from within DllMain:</p><ul><li>Call LoadLibrary or LoadLibraryEx (either directly or indirectly). This can cause a deadlock or a crash.</li><li>Call GetStringTypeA, GetStringTypeEx, or GetStringTypeW (either directly or indirectly). This can cause a deadlock or a crash.</li><li>Synchronize with other threads. This can cause a deadlock.</li><li>Acquire a synchronization object that is owned by code that is waiting to acquire the loader lock. This can cause a deadlock.</li><li>Initialize COM threads by using CoInitializeEx. Under certain conditions, this function can call LoadLibraryEx.</li><li>Call the registry functions.</li><li>Call CreateProcess. Creating a process can load another DLL.</li><li>Call ExitThread. Exiting a thread during DLL detach can cause the loader lock to be acquired again, causing a deadlock or a crash.</li><li>Call CreateThread. Creating a thread can work if you do not synchronize with other threads, but it is risky.</li><li>Call ShGetFolterPathW. Calling shell/known folder APIs can result in thread synchronization, and can therefore cause deadlocks.</li><li>Create a named pipe or other named object (Windows 2000 only). In Windows 2000, named objects are provided by the Terminal Services DLL. If this DLL is not initialized, calls to the DLL can cause the process to crash.</li><li>Use the memory management function from the dynamic C Run-Time (CRT). If the CRT DLL is not initialized, calls to these functions can cause the process to crash.</li><li>Call functions in User32.dll or Gdi32.dll. Some functions load another DLL, which may not be initialized.</li><li>Use managed code.</li></ul></blockquote><p>As laid out by Microsoft, these are the "Best Practices" for what can be done safely from <code>DllMain</code> without potentially bad things or unintended side effects happening, if not a deadlock or crash all together. Ah yes, these limitations have caused so many, so much pain! <em>A moment of silence for all the Win32 devs, please.</em></p><h2 id="where-we-re-at">Where We're At<a aria-label="Anchor link for: where-we-re-at" class="zola-anchor" href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/#where-we-re-at">🔗</a></h2><p>The starting point for my research was primarily an informative article called <strong><a href="https://www.netspi.com/blog/technical/adversary-simulation/adaptive-dll-hijacking/" target="_blank">"Adaptive DLL Hijacking"</a> by security professional Nick Landers (@monoxgas) at NetSPI</strong>. This is exceptional research and I've experimented with some of the resulting techniques and tools (such as Koppeling) myself in the past. As with all fantastic research, it must be innovated upon further, which is exactly what we're doing today!</p><p>Current projects around the Internet for performing <strong>universal</strong> DLL hijacking (only involving <code>DllMain</code>) all require you to do one of two problematic actions:</p><ol><li>Change memory protection (with <code>VirtualProtect</code>)</li><li>Modify pointers</li></ol><p>Number one is less than ideal because anti-malware solutions flag on <code>VirtualProtect</code> operations. Especially ones that create read-write-execute memory or convert memory from read-write ➜ read-execute. This is for good reason because changing executable memory protection is indicative of self-modifying code techniques, which is perhaps the easiest way to bypass static anti-malware detections. A process with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/exploit-protection-reference#arbitrary-code-guard" target="_blank">arbitrary code guard (ACG)</a> enabled blocks creation or modification of executable memory altogether.</p><p>I've seen some cases where API call instrumentation with <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Detours" target="_blank">Microsoft Detours</a> was used as a technique. While it may work, it results in a largely increased DLL size and anti-malware solutions will flag this down without a second thought. Also, it's not ACG compatible because it changes exectuable memory protection.</p><p>Number two is also less than ideal because pointers are the target of almost all next-generation exploit mitigations. For instance, a function's return address on the stack being modified to get code execution after Locker Lock is released. This technique had a good run where it was applicable but is due to break under an upcoming exploit mitigation called Intel Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET). CET cross-references function return addresses on the stack with a "shadow stack" locked away in the CPU hardware to ensure they're valid and untampered with; otherwise, forcefully terminating the offending process. There will probably come a day when all pointers are authenticated 1:1, so it's best to future-proof our techniques by avoiding pointer modification entirely.</p><p>In other words, we're striving for a data-only technique.</p><p>I've also noticed that some existing techniques, while versatile, are a bit long/complex or are designed for either dynamic load (<code>LoadLibrary</code>) or static loads (typically not including process startup, e.g. due to <code>NtContinue</code>). Some methods also need to feature stable process continuation.</p><p>Avoiding these problematic actions are requirements for the new techniques we will be exploring here.</p><h2 id="security-researcher-mindset">Security Researcher Mindset<a aria-label="Anchor link for: security-researcher-mindset" class="zola-anchor" href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/#security-researcher-mindset">🔗</a></h2><p>When you're exploring unchartered territory, it's easy to become confused and give up too quickly. This is why it's important to remind ourselves of what we have to work with so creativity can take hold. For me, before researching this, I had just come out of exploiting, and responsibly reporting to HackerOne, a memory corruption issue (e.g. a buffer overflow) where the bug I had found allowed untrusted data to control the destination of a <code>call</code> instruction (i.e. arbitrary <strong>call</strong>) thus eventually giving way to arbitrary code execution on a remote computer.</p><p>In the context of a DLL hijacking, we are granted access to <strong>all three</strong> basic primitives, including arbitrary <strong>read, write, and call</strong> to <em>anywhere</em> in the program's (virtual) memory (!). We also have easy access to <strong>tons</strong> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_machine" target="_blank">weird machines</a> (many, many lines of code) that exist in Windows libraries because we're the ones writing the code (even if our code is run under Loader Lock in <code>DllMain</code>). Furthermore, we can interact with weird machines outside our hijacked process' virtual memory space by using system calls to talk to the kernel. It's easy to take these luxuries for granted until you're under more constrained attack scenarios.</p><p>All this is to say that the odds that there don't exist many mechanisms that can allow us to cleanly (e.g. without changing memory protection) redirect code execution from <code>DllMain</code> after Loader Lock is released (or even find out how to disable it altogether) are essentially zero. As researchers, we can explore confidently, knowing we will find what we seek. This is the mindset I began my search with.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><img alt="Information alert" src="https://elliotonsecurity.com/assets/images/alert-icons/circle-info-solid.svg" style="width:24px;height:24px" width="24" height="24"><span style="font-weight:700">Info</span><br> Loader lock isn't a security boundary, just a nuisance for some programming use cases and DLL hijacking.

</span></code></pre><p><strong>However, it's important to note that realistically, you would continue running out of the legitimate (but hijacked) process; otherwise, that defeats the purpose of DLL hijacking (in most scenarios).</strong> For red teaming, spawning a reverse shell (e.g. with Metasploit or Colbalt Strike) in the legitimate process while otherwise letting the program run as normal (with no sign that anything out of the ordinary has happened) would probably be the ideal final payload.</p><p>Why <code>ShellExecute</code>? Well, <code>ShellExecute</code> works amazingly well as a litmus test for anything that could go wrong in NTDLL. This is because it's widely known the vast amount of Windows subsystems this one API call interacts with. Everything from the library loader, to COM/COM+ infrastructure, using ALPC, RPC, WinRT storage calls, CRT functions, registry functions, it even creates an entire <strong>new thread</strong> just to launch that one application, the calculator (<code>calc</code> or <code>C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe</code>)! <code>ShellExecute</code> is probably the single most bloated and complex API call in the whole of Windows API (after <code>ShellExecuteEx</code>, of course). So, it stands to reason that we can validate the success of a technique in practice by calling it.</p><p>As with most things involving <code>DllMain</code>, trying to call <code>ShellExecute</code> (and especially <code>ShellExecute</code>) without doing anything else fails spectacularly with an ominous deadlock at <code>ntdll!NtAlpcSendWaitReceivePort</code> (??) causing the program to hang indefinitely:</p><div style="text-align:center"><figure><a href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/shellexecute-initial-deadlock-point.png" target="_blank"> <img src="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/shellexecute-initial-deadlock-point.png"> </a></figure></div><p>Searching that function up (or any of its neighbors) yields little to no results because it's nearly all entirely undocumented! I love it when that happens.</p><p>Other times, you can crash with an <code>ntdll!TppRaiseInvalidParameter</code> exception because an internal function wanted to raise a nice <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-erref/596a1078-e883-4972-9bbc-49e60bebca55" target="_blank">NTSTATUS</a> (in this case, <code>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</code>) a few miles deep into the call stack (???).

This makes it perfect for ensuring our new techniques will work universally. What makes <code>OfflineScannerShell.exe</code> a worst-case scenario comes down to a few things:</p><ul><li>Won't call exports of hijackable DLL, so using <code>DllMain</code> to redirect code execution is a must <ul><li>Many programs with hijackable DLLs exit early unless very specific preconditions <ul><li>Often times, it's not possible to meet these preconditions</li></ul></li><li>I verified this for <code>OfflineScannerShell.exe</code> by setting a breakpoint on every function exported by <code>MpClient.dll</code> then running the program to check for breakpoint hits</li></ul></li><li>Program exits <em>immediately</em> after starting (doesn't stay open, idle, or wait)</li><li>Hijackable DLL is loaded statically; especially at <strong>process startup</strong> (not dynamically loaded by calling <code>LoadLibrary</code> at program run-time) <ul><li>Generally speaking, because you're deeper in library loader internals (the process is still starting up)</li></ul></li></ul><p>That's basically it. <strong>If your target program calls an export of your hijackable DLL at some point in its lifetime, then you're golden because you can just redirect code execution from there without having to worry about the struggles of <code>DllMain</code> and <code>Loader Lock</code> at all.</strong> This is sometimes referred to as DLL proxying. However, in the majority of cases I've seen when a DLL is hijackable, it's usually a very obscure library that's called a few times very deep into the application's code where there may be no way of easily (if at all) reaching unless the program is called in exactly the correct environment. Anything else, and it will simply exit immediately because, for example, you're running a service executable which links with a hijackable DLL. But, as soon as you run the service executable, it's going to see it wasn't started correctly (as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_service" target="_blank">Windows service</a>) and immediately close. This complicates what should be a simple hijacking process, considering we were already granted code execution in <code>DllMain</code> when the application started, just under the infamous Loader Lock.</p><p>As I learned, the only favorable thing about <code>OfflineScannerShell.exe</code> from a DLL hijacking perspective is that it links with a C runtime (CRT); in other words, it's not a pure Windows API (Win32) program. The vast majority of programs in Windows link with a CRT, though, so it's not a unique advantage. Why this is favorable, we will cover later.</p><h2 id="new-techniques">New Techniques<a aria-label="Anchor link for: new-techniques" class="zola-anchor" href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/#new-techniques">🔗</a></h2><h3 id="racing-the-main-thread">Racing the Main Thread<a aria-label="Anchor link for: racing-the-main-thread" class="zola-anchor" href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/#racing-the-main-thread">🔗</a></h3><p>This technique mainly builds on insights from "Adaptive DLL Hijacking" posted on NetSPI.</p><p>My initial expansions on this technique could not achieve a 100% success rate for our target.

But there's a catch because the thread created by calling <code>CreateThread</code> will wait (in more ways than one) until we leave <code>DllMain</code> to begin execution. Pulling this off then requires that we call <code>CreateThread</code>, allow the program to exit <code>DllMain</code> (Loader Lock and friends are released shortly thereafter), and hope that the thread is created before the main thread exits the program.</p><p>Creating a thread is a relatively expensive operation, so if our target program exits fairly quickly, we may not win this race.

However, at the time, I was only a novice C and Win32 programmer with no WinDbg experience, so I couldn't quickly figure it out then. Then I forgot about the issue entirely and worked on more pressing matters.</p><p>The bug stems from the fact that <code>GetCurrentThread</code> does <strong>not</strong> return a handle; it returns a <strong>pseudo</strong> handle. <code>GetCurrentThread</code> is merely a stub that (on x86-64) always returns the constant <code>0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFE</code>:</p><div style="text-align:center"><figure><a href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/getcurrentthread-disassembly.png" target="_blank"> <img src="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/getcurrentthread-disassembly.png"> </a></figure></div><p>Thus, passing that value to our new thread will cause it to refer to the thread it was passed to, <em>not</em> the thread we called <code>GetCurrentThread</code> on. The bug is quite subtle and easy to miss (especially if you're less familiar with Win32 programming as was I some years ago when initially attempting this idea). The correct approach for accomplishing what we want is:</p><pre class="language-C" data-lang="C" style="background:#fafafa;color:#61676c"><code class="language-C" data-lang="C"><span style="font-style:italic;color:#55b4d4">HANDLE</span><span> mainThread </span><span style="color:#ed9366">= </span><span style="color:#f29718">OpenThread</span><span>(THREAD_SUSPEND_RESUME</span><span style="color:#61676ccc">, </span><span style="color:#ff8f40">FALSE</span><span style="color:#61676ccc">, </span><span style="color:#f29718">GetCurrentThreadId</span><span>())</span><span style="color:#61676ccc">;
</span></code></pre><p>We create a <strong>real</strong> handle to the main thread from the current thread <strong>ID</strong> which can then correctly be passed as an argument to our new thread. Giving our handle only the minimum <code>THREAD_SUSPEND_RESUME</code> permissions required, our use case works out perfectly.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, passing our new thread the main thread's ID and then creating a handle from it on the new thread would probably result in clearer code. In our unique situation, though, we want to suspend the main thread from our new thread <em>as fast as possible</em> so opening the handle ahead of time is the better choice. We just have to be extra careful about not forgetting to <code>CloseHandle</code> from our new thread so we don't leak resources. Windows also limits the number of handles a single process can have, so if an adversary can leak large amounts of handles, that could effectively DoS our application. Anyway, this isn't a lesson in programming but it's always good to know best practices (as we ironically continue to steamroll all of them)!</p><h5 id="the-problem-with-suspendthread">The problem with SuspendThread...<a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-problem-with-suspendthread" class="zola-anchor" href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/#the-problem-with-suspendthread">🔗</a></h5><p>The final challenge to overcome with this technique is one Microsoft has summarized well for us in their <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-suspendthread#remarks" target="_blank">SuspendThread</a> documentation:</p><blockquote><p>This function is primarily designed for use by debuggers. It is not intended to be used for thread synchronization. Calling SuspendThread on a thread that owns a synchronization object, such as a mutex or critical section, can lead to a deadlock if the calling thread tries to obtain a synchronization object owned by a suspended thread. To avoid this situation, a thread within an application that is not a debugger should signal the other thread to suspend itself. The target thread must be designed to watch for this signal and respond appropriately.</p></blockquote><p>This entails the biggest problem with the race approach. In <code>OfflineScannerShell.exe</code>, this issue surfaces every ten or so executions because the main thread will be suspended while it's doing a heap memory allocation/free. In Windows, each process has a default heap provided by the system (you can get it with the <code>GetProcessHeap</code> function). This heap is created with the <code>HEAP_NO_SERIALIZE</code> flag (serialization referring to operations being doing in <em>series</em> as opposed to in <em>parallel</em>) unset which means that calls to heap allocation and free functions cause the heap to become locked then unlocked to ensure thread safety. For performance reasons, it may be desirable to create a non-serializing heap (<code>HeapCreate</code> with <code>HEAP_NO_SERIALIZE</code> set), in which case it would be the programmer's responsibility to either only use that heap on a single thread or ensure safe access across threads. We can do a one-time removal of the process heap lock by calling <code>HeapUnlock(GetProcessHeap())</code> from our new thread. However, this breaks thread safety guarantees which could cause the program to crash or other unintended side effects.</p><p>For example, in our tests we're using <code>ShellExecute</code> running <code>calc</code> as our final payload to run from the new thread. Well, <code>ShellExecute</code> (among many other Win32 functions) must make allocations to the process heap to work, which is where a deadlock could occur if we don't unlock the heap. It's worth noting that I've yet to realize the risk of a crash upon <code>HeapUnlock</code>, however, the chance of one occurring is non-zero as soon as we <code>HeapUnlock(GetProcessHeap())</code> then our new thread or another thread does a <code>HeapAlloc</code> (or an equivalent like <code>malloc</code>).</p><p></p><div style="text-align:center"><figure><a href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/heap-allocate-deadlock-thread-1.png" target="_blank"> <img src="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/heap-allocate-deadlock-thread-1.png"> </a></figure></div><div style="text-align:center"><figure><a href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/heap-allocate-deadlock-thread-2.png" target="_blank"> <img src="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/heap-allocate-deadlock-thread-2.png"> </a></figure></div><em>Deadlock occurs because the suspended main thread is holding the heap lock (i.e. critical section) while the new thread tries to acquire it.

It was an interesting experiment, but we can do better.</p><p>In essence, we need to be able to control where the main thread is when we suspend it from the new thread. The cleanest way I can think of doing this is by using locks to our advantage. We could acquire some lock in <code>DllMain</code> (stay with me here) that would cause the main thread to stop at a predictable point in the code because it's waiting to acquire the same lock. When our new thread launches, we run our payload, then release that lock so the program can continue to run freely like normal (and to ensure we don't exit too quickly). Using this method, we wouldn't even have to do any thread suspension because the locks do all our work for us! I have yet to try this because I only came up with the idea while writing this article, but it sounds like a winning strategy.</p><p>More on this in another article!</p><h4 id="detection-heuristics">Detection Heuristics<a aria-label="Anchor link for: detection-heuristics" class="zola-anchor" href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/#detection-heuristics">🔗</a></h4><p>Still, calling <code>CreateThread</code> from <code>DllMain</code> (along with some other heuristics) could be used as a signature for detection by anti-malware software so for red teaming the technique leaves something to be desired. If defenders want to use this as a heuristic for detecting DLL hijacking then I advise you to hook where <code>ntdll!LdrpCallInitRoutine</code> initially calls into our DLL using the code pointer at our library's <code>LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY.EntryPoint</code> (that would lead to <code>&lt;DLL_NAME&gt;!dllmain_dispatch</code> in our case). You can see what this <a href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/#our-payload">call stack</a> looks like from an image shown previously in the Our Payload section. If you see any potentially suspicious Windows API calls like <code>CreateThread</code> being made in that interval, it could be a symptom of DLL hijacking. It's essential to do it like this instead of simply analyzing the call stack whenever certain suspicious Windows API functions are called because the call stack can too easily be temporarily spoofed. Even with Intel CET, the call stack can still be temporarily faked (e.g. before calling <code>CreateThread</code>), followed by changing it back to pass the return address integrity check on function (<code>DllMain</code>) return.</p><h3 id="escaping-at-the-exit">Escaping at the Exit<a aria-label="Anchor link for: escaping-at-the-exit" class="zola-anchor" href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/#escaping-at-the-exit">🔗</a></h3><div style="text-align:center"><figure><a href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/atexit-sign.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/atexit-sign.jpg"> </a></figure></div><p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C" target="_blank">standard C</a>, there exists a function called <code>atexit</code> whose purpose is to (no surprise) run the given function at program exit.

That command lists some locks, but for whatever reason, <code>ntdll!LdrpLoaderLock</code> (even when locked) isn't included. So, there was no easy way of finding this out without scouring the Internet, searching debug symbol names, or setting breakpoints on NTDLL critical section functions (although I was unaware of how Loader Lock was implemented then).</p><pre style="background:#fafafa;color:#61676c"><code><span>0:000&gt; !locks -v

It's existed as a built-in system library since Windows 95 and still exists in the <code>C:\Windows\System32</code> of modern Windows installations.</strong> It provides a terribly broken, in terms of compliance to the C standard, C runtime. It's so broken, in fact, that Microsoft removed developers' ability to link to it using Visual Studio long ago. However, Microsoft understands their own bugs and, as a result, still links to it for many programs that ship with Windows (unless it's a pure Win32 application without a CRT or possibly uses the newer UCRT released with Windows 10). All this is in line with Microsoft's uncontested reputation as the king of backward compatibility. That's the jist of it.

Why yes, but we will have to switch out of Visual Studio and compile with a specific version of the Windows Driver Kit (WDK). Using WDK (which, despite its name, can also compile regular user-mode programs), we can link <strong>directly</strong> to <code>msvcrt.dll</code>! Compiling with MinGW likely works, too. This turns the contents of our <code>DllMain</code> (after boilerplate) back into a single line of code:</p><pre class="language-C" data-lang="C" style="background:#fafafa;color:#61676c"><code class="language-C" data-lang="C"><span style="color:#f29718">atexit</span><span>(CustomPayloadFunction)</span><span style="color:#61676ccc">;

I'm also not immediately aware of any security product hooking user-mode calls for anything outside of <code>ntdll.dll</code>/<code>kernel32.dll</code> (or at least certainly not CRT DLLs). User-mode hooks exist in a program's (virtual) memory, which makes bypassing them always possible. This is unlike kernel callbacks, where a user-mode program has no privileges to touch the kernel (that's a hard security boundary which would require a privilege escalation exploit). So, this technique is evasive as far as common run-time indicators go.</p><p>Doing static analysis to detect calling <code>atexit</code> (or <code>_onexit</code>) inside of <code>DllMain</code> could work at first. However, it would only start a cat-and-mouse game and be trivially easy to bypass. For example, an attacker could call to <code>atexit</code> anywhere in their DLL code (outside of <code>DllMain</code>, in unused code), emit a unique identifier in the code (e.g. using <code>db</code> assembly instructions), then use an <strong>egg hunter</strong> (typically used in exploit development but could also be used to evade detection in this context) to search for that identifier with the address to <code>atexit</code> right after it. A tiny bit of assembly to dynamically <code>call</code> that address, probably stored in a register (e.g. <code>call rax</code>), is all it would take then.</p><p>Of course, there's nothing suspicious about <code>atexit</code> (e.g. in the Import Address Table of a binary) on its own, unlike <code>CreateRemoteThread</code> as an obvious counter-example.</p><p>A heuristic could be created that detects if a process is spending an abnormally long time in <code>atexit</code> handlers. Let's call it a bonus if the heuristic detects a benign application spending an exorbitant amount of time in <code>atexit</code> handlers as that sounds like it would probably be a bug to me. This could be combined with detecting entries in the CRT <code>_onexit_table_t</code> table pointing to DLL code. In particular, if sensitive Win32 functions are used (detect this with kernel callbacks) during execution of the DLL's <code>atexit</code> handler.</p><p><strong>An interesting realization is that <code>atexit</code> could be used as a <em>natural</em> method for ensuring an attacker's real payload is never executed under a malware analysis sandbox</strong> <em>if</em> the sandbox isn't running the sample DLL in a program (EXE) linked with the same CRT as the DLL's target program (e.g. MSVCRT for <code>OfflineScannerShell.exe</code>). Malware analyis services like <a href="https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/" target="_blank">Hybrid Analysis</a> should <strong>ensure DLL samples are run in at least both UCRT and MSVCRT environments to catch this sandbox evasion trick.</strong></p><p>While one could further improve identification of this particular technique, I think that effort would be better spent detecting the broader class of DLL hijacking, which we will discuss later.</p><h4 id="approved-by-microsoft-r">Approved by Microsoft®?<a aria-label="Anchor link for: approved-by-microsoft-r" class="zola-anchor" href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/#approved-by-microsoft-r">🔗</a></h4><p>By setting a breakpoint on <code>msvcrt!atexit</code>, I've been able to spot one occurrence of Microsoft themselves calling the same CRT <code>atexit</code> typically used by EXEs under Loader Lock:</p><div style="text-align:center"><figure><a href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/microsoft-calls-crt-atexit-under-loader-lock.png" target="_blank"> <img src="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/microsoft-calls-crt-atexit-under-loader-lock.png"> </a></figure></div><p>So there you have it, it's essentially...</p><div class="alert alert-success"><img alt="Success alert" src="https://elliotonsecurity.com/assets/images/alert-icons/badge-check.svg" style="width:24px;height:24px" width="24" height="24"><span style="font-weight:700">Microsoft Approved</span><br> We're already doing this in production. 😎</div><p>Alright, alright, while Loader Lock is present here, there's still the clear difference between calling the CRT <code>atexit</code> from the CRT DLL code versus any other DLL calling it. Someone could call <code>FreeLibrary</code> on our DLL, causing our <code>atexit</code> handler to vanish from memory while it's still referenced by the CRT. This dangling pointer would then cause a crash on exit.</p><p>However, this is a more minor problem than one may think. It turns out that, for DLLs loaded statically (at least at process startup), <code>FreeLibrary</code> won't decrement the library's reference count thereby ensuring our DLL is never unloaded from memory, even if explicitly freed many times (confirmed in testing). In the dynamic loading case (<code>LoadLibrary</code>), we can call <code>LdrAddRefDll</code> (an NTDLL export) to increment the reference count on our DLL because the loader will never unload a library if its reference count is non-zero. All in all, as long as you throw in a <code>LdrAddRefDll</code> (and your EXE is linked with the correct CRT; otherwise, there will simply be no effect), this technique is guaranteed to be <strong>100% safe™</strong>.</p><h3 id="unlocking-loader-lock">Unlocking Loader Lock<a aria-label="Anchor link for: unlocking-loader-lock" class="zola-anchor" href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/#unlocking-loader-lock">🔗</a></h3><p>Okay, all this is great. But what if we want to run our final payload <em>straight</em> from <code>DllMain</code>? Not deferring it to later, I'm talking about unlocking the loader while still in <code>DllMain</code>. At which point, we can do everything we want to do, with <code>DllMain</code> still in the call stack if we want it to be. Well, it took a small feat in reverse engineering the Windows loader (contained within <code>ntdll.dll</code>), but after some hours in WinDbg I figured it out.</p><p>From research done in our previous technique, we already know that if we want to change the status of Loader Lock, we will have to modify the critical section at <code>ntdll!LdrpLoaderLock</code>. But we can't do that without knowing the location of the <code>ntdll!LdrpLoaderLock</code> symbol, which we won't know outside our debugger (where Microsoft's debug symbols are automatically downloaded). Technically, it's possible to download debug symbols for the current Microsoft binary files ahead of time, have our process load them, and then look up their locations in our process. However, that's complex and not a tenable solution to me.</p><p>Searching the Internet about the Loader Lock critical section, I came across the ReactOS source code for a promising function called <a href="https://doxygen.reactos.org/d7/d55/ldrapi_8c.html#a62b7a5edb61dfa0876b4e928cf510922" target="_blank">LdrUnlockLoaderLock</a>. ReactOS is an open source reimplementation of Windows built from the ground up by reverse engineering Microsoft Windows - so it goes without saying that their work is invaluable.</p><p>Checking with <code>dumpbin.exe /exports C:\Windows\System32\ntdll.dll</code> (<code>dumpbin.exe</code> is a tool installed with Visual Studio), I was able to confirm that <code>LdrUnlockLoaderLock</code> is an export of <code>ntdll.dll</code> which means we could easily get its location via dynamic linking or <code>GetProcAddress</code> then presumably call it to unlock the loader!</p><p>Taking a look at the function signature for <code>LdrUnlockLoaderLock</code> from the ReactOS source code, it seems to take a <code>Cookie</code> parameter:</p><pre class="language-C" data-lang="C" style="background:#fafafa;color:#61676c"><code class="language-C" data-lang="C"><span style="font-style:italic;color:#abb0b6">// NOTE: I have since fixed a bug in ReactOS where the cookie value was origianlly of type ULONG; not ULONG_PTR

So, it makes sense that the loader's inner workings have significantly changed between then and newer versions of Windows.

</span></code></pre><p><strong>After repeated testing, it's achieved an impressive 100% success rate! It works every time.</strong></p><p>There's still a bit more loader reverse engineering work to be done if we want to call <code>ShellExecute</code> (or other Windows API calls) without having to preload libraries for the current thread. To figure this out, I recommend setting breakpoints on functions <code>NtSetEvent</code>, <code>NtResetEvent</code>, <code>RtlEnterCriticalSection</code>, <code>RtlLeaveCriticalSection</code> and <code>NtWaitForSingleObject</code>. Setting read/write watchpoints and searching (with the <code>#</code> command as we did before) NTDLL's disassembly for references to loader state variables like <code>ntdll!LdrpWorkInProgress</code> would probably help, too. Basically, finding some piece of NTDLL state you can set before calling <code>ShellExecute</code> that will trigger <code>ntdll!LdrpWorkInProgress</code> to become <code>FALSE</code> on its own in the first thread launched by <code>ShellExecute</code>. That's one theory on what needs to happen, but it's most likely more subtle than that (involving some overlooked control flow; possibly touching <code>ntdll!LdrpWorkInProgress</code> won't even be necessary then). There must be a way to do it. However, it would take some looking into. Feel free to take a shot at this yourself!</p><p>Alternatively, we can work around this minor inconvenience entirely by setting <code>ntdll!LdrpWorkInProgress</code> to <code>FALSE</code>, calling <code>CreateThread</code> (this never loads additional libraries), waiting on the new thread from <code>DllMain</code> with <code>WaitForSingleObject(payloadThread, INFINITE)</code>, then calling <code>ShellExecute</code> (or any payload we want) from our new thread - no "library preloading" required. This workaround is what I recommend for utilizing this technique in practice. However, in this demonstration, I wanted to fulfill precisely what I set out to do by running <code>ShellExecute</code> <em>directly</em> from <code>DllMain</code>!</p><p>To verify that our <code>ShellExecute</code> litmus test holds up in reality, I also tried performing a number of other complex operations from <code>DllMain</code> (<code>RUN_PAYLOAD_DIRECTLY_FROM_DLLMAIN</code> undefined) that failed prior to unlocking the loader. This includes successfully downloading a file using WinHTTP; a notable improvement over first deadlocking when we call <code>WinHttpOpen</code> because <code>WINHTTP_DLL::Startup</code> internally calls into <code>__delayLoadHelper2</code> to load <code>ws2_32.dll</code>. <strong>Everything I've attempted thus far has worked flawlessly!</strong> <strong>Update from the future:</strong> Actually dummy, the reason you are getting this specific deadlock in the <code>ntdll!LdrpDrainWorkQueue</code> function was because you were accidentally messing with the loader internals (specifically resetting the <code>ntdll!LdrpWorkCompleteEvent</code>, which at the time you were completely confused on the function of because you kept messing with the loader's locks/state leading to outcomes that would not usually occur) while running this test. However, you were right that <a href="https://github.com/ElliotKillick/operating-system-design-review/tree/main/windows/winhttp-dllmain-debugging.log" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WinHTTP from <code>DllMain</code> can deadlock you</a> (just not in the way you described) and that Windows delay loading is not a good thing.</p><h4 id="safety">Safety!<a aria-label="Anchor link for: safety" class="zola-anchor" href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/#safety">🔗</a></h4><p>Safety, safety, safety, calling <code>ShellExecute</code> from <code>DllMain</code> safety, okay, let's talk about safety! The most obvious unsafe thing being done in this technique is directly interacting with NTDLL at all. In Windows, anything in NTDLL is subject to change across Windows versions. Microsoft exposes many NTDLL functions through a stable KERNEL32 API which can be depended on to stay the same. With that said, I tried to target parts of NTDLL that have probably remained largely untouched to decrease the chance of breakage occurring in this way. For example, I used straightforward and smaller NTDLL exports like <code>LdrUnlockLoaderLock</code> and <code>RtlExitUserProcess</code> as jumping-off points for locating some of the NTDLL internals we need to make this work.</p><p>Let's assume the implementation details we depend on are mature, making them likely to stay the same. Also, that we already have the addresses for the NTDLL internals we need (maybe we can lookup debug symbols in our process). How safe is it then?</p><p>Some technical Windows experts might say that how we use the loader's internal synchronization mechanisms violates a lock hierarchy. Therefore, even if it never becomes an issue in our process alone, some remote process could legally spawn a thread into our process and do some unspecified concurrent operations with the loader, thus causing a deadlock/crash. I've maintained the loader's lock hierarchy as best I can, given that we don't have access to any internal Microsoft documentation. To keep in line with our goal of <strong>respecting the lock hierarchy</strong>, we avoid lock order inversion issues by locking back up in the same order that the loader presumably locks in (this is also implemented for events in <code>modifyLdrEvents</code>).</p><p>For instance, one well-known case where the NT kernel will spawn a thread into your process is for handling <code>Ctrl+C</code> events. However, that can only happen on console subsystem programs whereas <code>OfflineScannerShell.exe</code> is a Windows subsystem (GUI) program.</p><p>At best, what we're doing is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_inversion" target="_blank">priority inversion</a>, which, while not being a good practice from a performance point of view due to causing a high-priority task to wait for a lower-priority task, is still not a deadlock/crash. At worst, we are violating a lock hierarchy or leaving the loader in an inconsistent state, which means bad things <em>could</em> happen.</p><p>If you're writing a real production application, then it goes without saying: don't try this at home. The point of this research is only to prove that fully unlocking the loader is <em>technically</em> possible (and on top of that, it's pretty epic). If you deploy this Loader Lock Rube Goldberg machine in production to millions of users, that's on you! Then again, technically possible is the best kind of possible. ;)</p><div style="text-align:center"><figure><a href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/technically-correct-meme.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/technically-correct-meme.jpg"> </a></figure></div><p>Really, though, if you're a developer writing production-grade software, don't do this - please. Even if you believe it's stable enough for you and don't wish to heed Microsoft's guidelines, searching assembly code to locate NTDLL internals in the same way will fail on non-Microsoft implementations of Windows. Also, the Wine and ReactOS loaders (based mostly on reverse engineered Windows Server 2003 code) looks nothing like the modern Windows 10 loader, so crashes due to significant changes in the implementation are inevitable.</p><p>As a side note, Wine's implementation of the <code>LdrUnlockLoaderLock</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Native_API" target="_blank">Native API</a> function (at <code>dlls/ntdll/loader.c</code> in the Wine source tree) looks like this:</p><pre class="language-C" data-lang="C" style="background:#fafafa;color:#61676c"><code class="language-C" data-lang="C"><span>NTSTATUS </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#55b4d4">WINAPI </span><span style="color:#f29718">LdrUnlockLoaderLock</span><span>( </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#55b4d4">ULONG </span><span style="color:#ff8f40">flags</span><span style="color:#61676ccc">, </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#55b4d4">ULONG_PTR </span><span style="color:#ff8f40">magic </span><span>)

Like a library's <code>DllMain</code>, a module constructor is run when the library is loaded (for unloads, there is also the module destructor). On Linux with the GCC compiler, any function can be marked with <code>__attribute__((constructor))</code> to run at load-time just as <code>DllMain</code> is.</p><p>Just like Windows, Linux (using glibc), of course, also has a 'loader lock' (or mutex) that ensures safety from race conditions across threads (I've read the source code).</p><p>So, <em>why then</em> if you search on Google for issues related to the respective loader locks do you only get problems arising on the Windows side of things.

Check the exports of the DLL in question, looking for symbol names that are duplicates of the names present in signed Microsoft DLLs (e.g. shipped with Windows at least). If a DLL unsigned by Microsoft exports many of the same symbol names as a Microsoft-signed DLL, then there's a good chance its intention is to hijack. This works because the Windows library loader will bail out early (before executing any <code>DllMain</code>s) if it sees that a DLL is missing an export required by the EXE:</p><div style="text-align:center"><figure><a href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/offlinescannershell-mpclient-dll-missing-export-error.png" target="_blank"> <img src="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/offlinescannershell-mpclient-dll-missing-export-error.png"> </a></figure></div><p>This could be combined with other detection factors, like whether the DLL on disk also shares the same filename as the DLL it's duplicating exports from or whether it exists in the <code>PATH</code> global environment variable or current working directory (CWD) of the running program to form a robust heuristic for DLL hijacking at least of built-in libraries.</p><p>It's a good idea to keep an eye on user-writable directories in the <code>PATH</code> by default such as <code>C:\Users\&lt;YOUR_USERNAME&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps</code> (as shown ealier). The same goes for the CWD if it's user-writable. This is especially true if <code>cmd.exe</code> or likewise is the parent process that CWD is being inherited from. <strong>Libraries loaded from either the user-writable <code>PATH</code> or CWD (these come last in the search order) should always be put under extra scrutiny.</strong> This also goes for a user-writable program directory if the program looks to have been copied from a <em>non</em> user-writable location.</p><p>Checking exports doesn't work for dynamically loaded DLLs (loaded via <code>LoadLibrary</code>). Although, loading DLLs this way is much less common.</p><p>To protect against that, one could detect Microsoft programs loading DLLs that aren't signed by Microsoft. This mitigation, in fact, already exists in Windows! Here's how we can use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/processmitigations/set-processmitigation" target="_blank">Set-ProcessMitigation</a> PowerShell cmdlet to effectively patch our target <code>OfflineScannerShell.exe</code> against DLL hijacking:</p><pre class="language-ps1" data-lang="ps1" style="background:#fafafa;color:#61676c"><code class="language-ps1" data-lang="ps1"><span style="color:#f07171">Set-ProcessMitigation </span><span style="color:#ed9366">-</span><span>Enable MicrosoftSignedOnly </span><span style="color:#ed9366">-</span><span>Name </span><span style="color:#f07171">OfflineScannerShell.exe
</span></code></pre><p><strong>And now, when we try hijacking any program named <code>OfflineScannerShell.exe</code>, we will receive an error message notifying us that our non-Microsoft signed DLL has been blocked:</strong></p><div style="text-align:center"><figure><a href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/offlinescannershell-mpclient-dll-unsigned-by-microsoft-error.png" target="_blank"> <img src="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/offlinescannershell-mpclient-dll-unsigned-by-microsoft-error.png"> </a></figure></div><p>So, just throw that registry value into all the systems in your organization and just like that, you will have easily foiled any hijacking attempts against <code>OfflineScannerShell.exe</code>!!</p><h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up<a aria-label="Anchor link for: wrapping-up" class="zola-anchor" href="https://elliotonsecurity.com/perfect-dll-hijacking/#wrapping-up">🔗</a></h2><p>We have successfully innovated on previous research to uncover some novel clean &amp; universal DLL hijacking techniques! We also learned a good bit about concurrency, the Windows library loader, modern Windows internals, WinDbg, and demystified the inner workings of Loader Lock. With any luck, our discoveries and mitigation/detection work will help push the security industry forward!</p><p>In Windows alone, there are countless opportunities for code injection into <strong>Microsoft signed</strong> programs using DLL hijacking (made better using our new techniques). In fact, security expert Wietze Beukema (@Wietze) has already compiled a list including hundreds of these programs with his project <strong><a href="https://hijacklibs.net/" target="_blank">HijackLibs</a></strong> (<strong>Sigma detections included</strong>)!</p><p>Our new DLL hijacking methods are also helpful for simplifying privilege escalation exploits where a privileged application accidentally loads an attacker-controlled DLL. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as when a privileged application is missing a DLL, potentially causing it to load from a user-writable path.</p><p>Apologies for not posting an article in two months. Going forward, I'm committed to publishing more shorter articles (still of the same quality) so I can share new content regularly. This article is about 9000 words long, so researching for then writing at most 1000 words per-article should get me there. More good stuff to come!</p><p>See the <strong>complete, open source code</strong> for everything we talked about here on the <a href="https://github.com/ElliotKillick/LdrLockLiberator"
