Title:
SourcePoint — Polymorphic Cobalt Strike Malleable C2 Profile Generator

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- SourcePoint is a Go-based generator that creates polymorphic Malleable C2 profiles for Cobalt Strike to reduce static indicators and improve C2 evasion.  
- It solves the operational problem of repeatedly hand-crafting and maintaining complex, environment-specific profiles by randomizing or parameterizing many profile features and producing ready-to-use output.  
- The project covers profile controls across global beacon behavior (sleep/jitter, user-agent, headers), HTTP(S) traffic shaping (multiple baked-in templates plus custom profiles), and in-memory tradecraft (staging options, syscall modes, sleep mask, smart inject, PE/reflective loader modifications).  
- It includes options for process injection behavior (allocator choice, RWX handling, minimum allocation, execution methods) and post-execution settings (spawnto, AMSI disable option, keylogger API choice, thread start spoofing).  
- Useful primarily for red teams and penetration testers running Cobalt Strike infrastructure; also relevant to blue teams for understanding how beacon profiles can be diversified to evade signature-based detections.  
- Interesting because it operationalizes many Malleable C2 and Beacon configuration knobs (including newer BeaconGate controls) into repeatable, on-the-fly profile generation.

Technical Focus:
- Cobalt Strike Malleable C2 profile generation and traffic shaping (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Beacon staging and reflective loader customization (stomppe, obfuscate, magic MZ/PE, transformations)
- Process injection configuration (VirtualAllocEx vs NtMapViewOfSection, memory permissions)
- Syscall modes (none/direct/indirect) and “smart inject”/sleep mask features
- Post-execution behavior tuning (spawnto, thread start spoofing, keylogger API selection)
- Redirector/edge compatibility (X-Forwarded-For, CloudFront/AzureEdge-oriented profiles)

Use Cases:
- Generate unique Malleable C2 profiles per operation/teamserver to reduce repeatable IoCs
- Rapidly prototype and test HTTP(S) beacon traffic patterns that blend with target environments
- Standardize profile hardening (sleep/jitter, data jitter, headers, staging choices) via YAML configs
- Tune injection and post-execution settings to match an engagement’s detection surface
- Create CloudFront/AzureEdge-compatible profiles and configure redirector-aware headers
