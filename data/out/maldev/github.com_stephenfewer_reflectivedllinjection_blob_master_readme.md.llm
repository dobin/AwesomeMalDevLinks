Title:
ReflectiveDLLInjection (Stephen Fewer) – Reflective DLL Injection / In-Memory PE Loader

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository implements “Reflective DLL Injection,” a technique where a DLL loads itself from an arbitrary memory location inside a target process by embedding a minimal PE loader (ReflectiveLoader).  
- It solves the problem of executing a DLL in a remote process without relying on the normal Windows loader to load the DLL from disk, by manually mapping headers/sections, resolving imports, and applying relocations.  
- The workflow assumes the DLL bytes are already written into the target process, then execution is transferred (e.g., via CreateRemoteThread or bootstrap shellcode) to the exported ReflectiveLoader.  
- ReflectiveLoader locates its own image in memory, finds kernel32 exports to resolve LoadLibraryA/GetProcAddress/VirtualAlloc, allocates memory, maps the image, fixes imports/relocations, and calls DllMain(DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH).  
- Useful primarily for red teams, pentesters, and malware developers as a foundational building block for in-memory module loading and process injection tradecraft.  
- It’s notable as a canonical reference implementation of reflective loading/manual mapping used widely in offensive tooling.

Technical Focus:
- Reflective DLL loading (manual PE mapping)
- Remote process injection (CreateRemoteThread / bootstrap shellcode)
- PE parsing (headers, sections, export/import tables)
- Import resolution via LoadLibraryA/GetProcAddress
- Relocations (base relocation processing)
- Kernel32 export table parsing / dynamic API resolution

Use Cases:
- Inject a DLL into a remote process without standard LoadLibrary-from-disk semantics
- Build custom in-memory loaders for post-exploitation payloads
- Research and prototype EDR-evasion-adjacent module loading techniques (manual mapping)
- Develop and test detection logic for reflective/manual-mapped modules
