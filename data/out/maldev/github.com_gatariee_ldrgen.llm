Title:
ldrgen — Template-based generation of shellcode loaders

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- ldrgen is a generator that produces Windows shellcode loader projects from predefined C templates and operator-defined profiles.  
- It aims to reduce the repetitive work of building new loader variants by templating source files, build artifacts, and configurable placeholders (e.g., encryption keys).  
- Templates are described in a `templates/config.yaml` that maps a “token” to required source files and substitution variables; profiles (JSON) select a template, set substitutions, choose architecture, and optionally compile automatically.  
- Example templates include a `CreateThread`-based loader that decrypts XOR-encrypted shellcode before allocating memory and executing it.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers/pentesters who maintain multiple loader implementations and want a consistent, automatable way to generate and compile them (e.g., via mingw-w64).  
- The interesting aspect is the separation of “loader engineering” (templates) from “operator configuration” (profiles), enabling fast iteration without making the tool a full framework.

Technical Focus:
- Template-driven C source generation with placeholder substitution
- Profile-based configuration (JSON) and template metadata (YAML)
- Windows shellcode loading primitives (VirtualAlloc, memcpy, CreateThread, WaitForSingleObject)
- Simple payload obfuscation/encryption workflow (XOR) and key injection
- Cross-compilation/build automation (make, x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc, i686-w64-mingw32-gcc, strip)

Use Cases:
- Generate repeatable Windows shellcode loader projects from a standard template library
- Rapidly produce loader variants by swapping templates, keys, and build settings
- Automate embedding/encrypting shellcode into a stageless loader build pipeline
- Maintain a personal catalog of loader implementations and compile them consistently for x86/x64
