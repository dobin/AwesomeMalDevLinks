Title:
DojoLoader — Generic PE loader for fast prototyping evasion techniques

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- DojoLoader is a modular in-memory PE loader designed to quickly prototype and test evasion techniques, originally built around running Cobalt Strike “UDRL-less” raw Beacon payloads.  
- It solves the problem of iterating on loader/sleep-obfuscation ideas without relying on UDRLs, reducing debugging and integration overhead.  
- The project extends a MemoryModule-style loader (inspired by ORCA000’s DynamicDllLoader) and adds payload retrieval (HTTP/file) with optional XOR encoding plus dynamic IAT hooking of `Sleep`.  
- It implements three sleep obfuscation approaches: classic RW→RX encryption/decryption, “MemoryBouncing” (freeing the mapped image during sleep and restoring it), and “MemoryHopping” (remapping at a new address and fixing execution via relocations/return-address adjustment).  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers, pentesters, and malware researchers evaluating EDR detection gaps around RX→RW and sleep-based heuristics.  
- The interesting aspect is the focus on avoiding common telemetry (e.g., `VirtualProtect` RX↔RW transitions) by removing or moving the payload during sleep and restoring execution safely.

Technical Focus:
- In-memory PE loading (MemoryModule-style mapping)
- Sleep obfuscation via IAT hooking (`Sleep`/`SleepEx`)
- RX→RW / RW→RX transition evasion strategies
- Payload staging over HTTP and local file with XOR encoding
- Memory remapping, relocations, and return-address adjustment

Use Cases:
- Rapid prototyping of loader-based EDR evasion concepts
- Testing sleep obfuscation variants against endpoint detections
- Executing UDRL-less Cobalt Strike Beacon payloads in-memory
- Researching detection opportunities around memory free/remap patterns
- Building custom loaders for controlled red team tradecraft experiments
