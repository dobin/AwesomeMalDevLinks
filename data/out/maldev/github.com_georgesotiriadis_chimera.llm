Title:
Chimera (Chimera Unlea$ed) — Automated DLL Sideloading Tool With EDR Evasion Capabilities

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
Chimera is a Python-based automation tool for generating malicious proxy DLL projects to perform DLL sideloading against specific legitimate applications (currently Microsoft Teams and OneDrive). It takes raw shellcode, encrypts/obfuscates it (XOR with random key or AES), and outputs Visual Studio-ready C/ASM templates that compile into a sideloadable DLL with the required exports. The project focuses on evading EDR/AV by using modified SysWhispers3-style dynamic syscalls, polymorphic code changes (e.g., NOP sleds/register shuffling), timing delays via waitable timers, and sandbox/debugging checks. It also supports process injection via Early Bird APC injection (with “Module Stomping” planned/placeholder). Useful primarily for red teams, pentesters, and malware developers building tradecraft around proxy DLL sideloading and syscall-based evasion; it’s interesting because it packages multiple evasion layers into a repeatable build workflow tied to real-world binaries and missing-DLL scenarios.

Technical Focus:
- DLL sideloading / proxy DLL generation (export forwarding)
- Shellcode encryption/obfuscation (XOR, AES)
- Dynamic syscalls (SysWhispers3) and syscall stub/ASM modification
- Early Bird APC injection (process injection)
- Sandbox/debugger evasion (disk checks, anti-debug)
- Execution delay via waitable timers (timing evasion)

Use Cases:
- Automate creation of sideloadable proxy DLLs for Teams/OneDrive-style missing DLL loads
- Generate encrypted shellcode loaders embedded in DLL templates for controlled execution
- Test EDR detection gaps around dynamic syscalls, polymorphism, and delayed execution
- Build and iterate on injection techniques (swap Early Bird with custom methods)
- Create reproducible lab PoCs for defensive validation of DLL search order abuse
