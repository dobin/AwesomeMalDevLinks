Title:
CallStackSpoofer (x64 Call Stack Spoofing)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository provides a C + x64 assembly implementation of call stack spoofing on Windows, intended to make sensitive API calls appear to originate from benign-looking call chains.  
- It targets detection mechanisms used by EDRs that rely on stack walking / call stack telemetry to attribute suspicious behavior (e.g., memory allocation, thread creation, syscalls) to untrusted modules.  
- The project includes an assembly “spoofer” stub and supporting headers/structs to craft a fake return-address chain and control the call flow while preserving correct calling conventions.  
- It serves as a practical companion to the author’s write-up on x64 call stack spoofing, focusing on implementation details rather than a full offensive framework.  
- Useful primarily for red team operators, implant/tooling developers, and security researchers evaluating stack-based detections and evasions.  
- Interesting because it demonstrates a common modern evasion primitive (stack spoofing) in a small, auditable codebase that can be integrated into custom loaders or post-exploitation tooling.

Technical Focus:
- Windows x64 calling convention and stack frames
- Call stack spoofing / return address chain fabrication
- Assembly stubs for indirect calls and control-flow manipulation
- Stack walking–based EDR telemetry evasion
- Low-level API invocation patterns (user-mode)

Use Cases:
- Integrate stack spoofing into a custom loader/implant to reduce suspicious call stack artifacts
- Research and reproduce EDR detections based on stack traces and validate bypass hypotheses
- Build test harnesses for defensive tooling that inspects call stacks (ETW/telemetry consumers)
- Educational reference for implementing x64 spoofing stubs in C/ASM
