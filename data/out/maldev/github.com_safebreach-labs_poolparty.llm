Title:
PoolParty — Process Injection via Windows Thread Pools (Black Hat EU 2023)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- PoolParty is a C++ proof-of-concept collection of process injection techniques that execute payloads by abusing Windows Thread Pool internals rather than creating new remote threads.  
- It targets EDR detection gaps around common injection primitives (e.g., CreateRemoteThread) by hijacking or planting thread-pool work items inside an existing target process.  
- The repo implements multiple variants, including overwriting a worker factory start routine and inserting crafted TP_* objects (TP_WORK, TP_WAIT, TP_IO, TP_ALPC, TP_JOB, TP_DIRECT, TP_TIMER) into the target’s thread pool structures.  
- Execution is triggered through legitimate thread pool mechanisms (e.g., timer queue expiration) after allocating/writing shellcode into the remote process.  
- Useful for red teams, pentesters, and malware researchers studying stealthy code execution and Windows internals; also relevant for blue teams building detections around thread pool manipulation.  
- Interesting because it operationalizes lesser-monitored kernel/user-mode primitives (worker factories, thread pool queues) into repeatable injection patterns presented at Black Hat EU 2023.

Technical Focus:
- Windows Thread Pool internals (TP_POOL and TP_* work item structures)
- Worker Factory hijacking / start routine overwrite
- Remote process memory allocation and shellcode staging
- Queue/list manipulation to enqueue crafted thread-pool objects
- Triggering execution via timer queue / thread pool dispatch paths
- EDR evasion via avoiding classic remote-thread creation

Use Cases:
- Stealthy payload execution inside a remote process without CreateRemoteThread
- Researching/demonstrating thread pool–based injection tradecraft
- Developing and validating defensive detections for thread pool tampering
- Comparing injection telemetry coverage across EDR products
- Training material for Windows internals and offensive code execution techniques
