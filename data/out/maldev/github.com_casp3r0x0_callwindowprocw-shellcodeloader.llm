Title:
CallWindowProcW-ShellcodeLoader

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- A minimal Windows shellcode loader written in C that executes payloads via the WinAPI function `CallWindowProcW` instead of creating a new thread.  
- It allocates memory for shellcode, copies it into the buffer, flips permissions to executable, then invokes the buffer as a window procedure callback.  
- The key idea is “callback-based execution” on an existing GUI thread, which can reduce telemetry associated with common patterns like `CreateThread`/`NtCreateThreadEx`.  
- This is primarily useful for red teamers, pentesters, and malware developers exploring alternative execution primitives and EDR evasion tradeoffs.  
- It’s interesting as a simple example of abusing legitimate GUI/message-processing APIs to blend execution into normal-looking control flow.

Technical Focus:
- WinAPI callback execution via `CallWindowProcW`
- Shellcode loading (allocate, copy, execute)
- Memory permission changes (RW → RX)
- GUI thread / message loop execution context
- EDR evasion via avoiding thread creation telemetry

Use Cases:
- Proof-of-concept callback-based shellcode execution on Windows
- Testing EDR detections focused on thread creation vs. callback execution
- Building blocks for custom loaders that execute within existing threads
- Training/demo code for Windows user32 callback abuse patterns
