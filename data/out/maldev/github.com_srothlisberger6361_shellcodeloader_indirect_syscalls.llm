Title:
ShellCodeLoader_Indirect_Syscalls (Shellcode Loader using indirect syscalls)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
This repository contains a Windows shellcode loader that executes payloads via indirect syscalls to reduce exposure to user-mode EDR API hooks. It re-implements the HellsGate approach for resolving syscall numbers/stubs, but uses an indirect syscall technique to make the call stack appear less anomalous than classic direct-syscall loaders. The project is explicitly inspired by BokuLoader and HellsGate and references MalwareTech’s write-up on bypassing user-mode hooks. It was built as an educational/CRTO2 preparation project and positioned as a stepping stone toward a User-Defined Reflective Loader (UDRL) style loader. The repo also includes tooling for API hashing (Python script) and notes planned work like custom GetProcAddress/GetModuleHandle and potentially manual mapping of ntdll. Useful primarily for red teamers, exploit devs, and malware researchers studying syscall-based evasion and loader tradecraft.

Technical Focus:
- Indirect syscalls vs direct syscalls (call stack evasion)
- HellsGate-style syscall stub/SSN resolution from ntdll
- Shellcode loading and in-memory execution on Windows
- User-mode EDR hook bypass concepts
- API hashing and custom API resolution (planned/partial)
- (Planned) ntdll manual mapping to avoid hooked exports

Use Cases:
- Build/test a standalone shellcode loader for research and debugging
- Experiment with bypassing user-mode API hooks by avoiding Win32 API call paths
- Prototype syscall-based execution primitives for custom loaders/UDRL concepts
- Study call stack artifacts and how indirect syscalls change telemetry
- Generate and use API hashes for stealthier import resolution
