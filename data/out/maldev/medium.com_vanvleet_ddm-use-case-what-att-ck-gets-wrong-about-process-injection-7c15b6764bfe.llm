Title:
DDM Use Case: What ATT&CK Gets Wrong about Process Injection

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- The post uses Detection Data Models (DDMs) to map Windows process injection (MITRE ATT&CK T1055) into operation chains (allocate/map memory → write payload → gain execution) and compares those chains across ATT&CK sub-techniques.  
- It argues ATT&CK’s sub-technique taxonomy is inconsistent because several sub-techniques are defined by payload type (PE/DLL) or optional steps (unmapping for hollowing) rather than a unique execution method, making them non-independent and overlapping.  
- The author shows “Thread Execution Hijacking,” “APC Injection,” “TLS Injection,” and “ListPlanting” form distinct execution paths, while “PE Injection,” “DLL Injection,” and “Process Hollowing” collapse into “New Thread Injection” plus procedural variants.  
- “Process Doppelganging” is highlighted as fundamentally different from injection (it manipulates image loading/identity), and is better grouped with Herpaderping under a proposed new technique like “Process Image Tampering.”  
- Useful for detection engineers and threat hunters who map telemetry to ATT&CK, and for red teamers who want clearer mental models of what defenders can (and can’t) distinguish.  
- Interesting because it provides a concrete method (DDMs) to critique and improve ATT&CK technique/sub-technique definitions based on operational uniqueness.

Technical Focus:
- Detection Data Models (DDMs) for technique decomposition
- Windows process injection execution primitives (APC, thread hijack, TLS callbacks, CreateRemoteThread)
- Memory operations: allocation vs section mapping, remote writes, protection changes
- Critique of ATT&CK sub-technique taxonomy (independence/uniqueness criteria)
- Process image masquerading/tampering: Doppelganging vs Herpaderping (TxF/rollback, on-disk vs in-memory mismatch)

Use Cases:
- Build detection logic around invariant operation chains instead of ATT&CK labels
- Normalize/clean up internal technique catalogs (merge/retire overlapping “sub-techniques”)
- Create hunting hypotheses for injection based on execution method (APC/TLS/thread hijack/new thread)
- Distinguish “process injection” telemetry from “process image tampering” telemetry in detections
- Improve purple-team mapping between adversary procedures and observable events
