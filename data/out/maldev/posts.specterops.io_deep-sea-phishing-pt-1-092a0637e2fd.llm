Title:
Deep Sea Phishing Pt. 1 — Phishing School: How to Bypass EDR With Custom Payloads

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post explains why “stock” payloads from common C2 frameworks are frequently detected as “known bad,” and argues for writing small custom implants to evade EDR during phishing/initial access.  
- It contrasts two approaches: custom shellcode loaders (still performing highly monitored shellcode behaviors and often loading known-bad beacons) versus writing a minimal custom implant that stays “unknown bad.”  
- The author walks through building a minimal reverse HTTPS shell in Nim, emphasizing modular design by separating task retrieval, output return, and (placeholder) crypto into swappable functions.  
- It adds practical operator considerations like per-implant identifiers to avoid “multiplayer mode,” basic data protection concepts (warning that encoding ≠ encryption), and environment keying to reduce sandboxing/collateral execution.  
- The key tradeoff highlighted is that adding features increases telemetry and signature surface; single-purpose initial access implants can be more durable.  
- Useful primarily for red teams/pentesters doing phishing and initial access who need lightweight, customizable payloads that avoid common EDR signatures.

Technical Focus:
- EDR “known bad” vs “unknown bad” detection and payload signatureability
- Minimal C2/implant architecture (tasking loop, command execution, output channel)
- Nim-based Windows implant development (HTTP(S) comms, process execution)
- Modular implant design (swappable transport/crypto components)
- Environment keying / sandbox evasion concepts
- Operational tradeoffs: feature creep vs telemetry/signature surface

Use Cases:
- Build a custom initial-access reverse shell to avoid signatures tied to common C2 frameworks
- Rapidly prototype bespoke phishing payloads with modular comms and execution logic
- Add per-host/instance identifiers for multi-session tasking separation
- Implement environment keying to prevent execution outside intended targets and frustrate sandboxes
- Swap transport (e.g., HTTPS/DNS) or execution mode (OS commands vs PowerShell/.NET) without rewriting core loop
