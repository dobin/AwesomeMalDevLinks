Title:
BokuLoader: Cobalt Strike User-Defined Reflective Loader (UDRL)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- BokuLoader is a proof-of-concept x64 Cobalt Strike User-Defined Reflective Loader intended to recreate and extend Cobalt Strike’s reflective loading and Malleable PE evasion behaviors.  
- It focuses on stealthy in-memory loading of Beacon with enhancements like reflective call stack spoofing (synthetic frames), custom API resolution (avoiding `GetProcAddress`/`LoadLibraryA`), and string/import obfuscation.  
- The loader supports multiple allocation strategies (HeapAlloc, MapViewOfFile, VirtualAlloc) and integrates/implements several Malleable PE options (e.g., `module_x64`, `entry_point`, `userwx`, `sleep_mask`, `obfuscate` with limitations).  
- It implements indirect NT syscalls (HellsGate/HalosGate) for memory operations (notably `NtProtectVirtualMemory`), aiming to reduce exposure to userland API hooks.  
- The repo also includes detection guidance describing signatureable strings, allocator artifacts, syscall patterns, and header/PE anomalies (e.g., first 0x1000 bytes zeroed).  
- Useful primarily for red teams and offensive tool developers building in-house CS loaders, and for blue teams researching detection opportunities around custom reflective loaders.

Technical Focus:
- User-Defined Reflective Loader (UDRL) for Cobalt Strike Beacon
- Reflective call stack spoofing (synthetic frames)
- Indirect/direct syscall techniques (HellsGate, HalosGate)
- Custom API/DLL resolution via PEB/TEB traversal (no `GetProcAddress`/`LoadLibraryA`)
- Malleable C2 “Malleable PE” evasion feature support (allocator, module stomping, sleepmask, userwx)
- Memory forensics/detection artifacts (header wiping, RWX/RX regions, syscall stubs)

Use Cases:
- Build and test custom Cobalt Strike reflective loaders for controlled red team operations
- Experiment with call stack spoofing and syscall-based memory protection changes
- Evaluate EDR detection gaps vs. userland-hook evasion approaches
- Develop defensive detections/signatures for UDRLs (strings, memory layout, syscall stub patterns)
- Research tradeoffs of different Beacon memory allocators and module stomping behaviors
