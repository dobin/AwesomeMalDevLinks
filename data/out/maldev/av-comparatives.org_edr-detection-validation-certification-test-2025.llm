Title:
AV-Comparatives EDR Detection Validation Certification Test 2025

Type:
Documentation

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- AV-Comparatives reports completion of its 2025 EDR Detection Validation Certification Test, an independent evaluation of enterprise EDR/XDR/MDR products under advanced threat scenarios.  
- The test focuses on detection and reporting quality (visibility/telemetry), not prevention, by running products in monitoring-only mode with prevention disabled.  
- It simulates complex APT-style attack chains mapped to MITRE ATT&CK TTPs and validates detections via console alerts and/or manual threat hunting in collected telemetry.  
- Certification is threshold-based: only products meeting the detection requirements are certified and publicly listed; results are intended to be viewed standalone rather than used for direct vendor comparisons.  
- Certified products listed include CrowdStrike Falcon Pro, ESET PROTECT Enterprise Cloud, G DATA 365 MXDR (MDR), Kaspersky Next EDR Expert (pilot), and Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR Pro.  
- Useful for security leaders, blue teams, and vendors who want an external signal of detection visibility and logging fidelity under controlled, realistic intrusion simulations.

Technical Focus:
- EDR/XDR/MDR detection validation methodology (monitoring-only testing)
- APT attack-chain simulation and kill-chain stage coverage
- MITRE ATT&CK TTP mapping
- Telemetry quality and threat-hunting validation in management consoles
- Certification thresholds, scoring transparency, and methodology iteration (pilot vs 2025)

Use Cases:
- Selecting or shortlisting EDR/XDR/MDR tools based on detection visibility rather than prevention claims
- Benchmarking SOC alerting and telemetry completeness against realistic attack chains
- Vendor validation of detection/reporting capabilities for certification and product improvement
- Designing internal purple-team evaluations modeled on ATT&CK-aligned intrusion chains
