Title:
Creating a 100% FUD crypter

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post is a tutorial-style write-up on building and maintaining an “FUD” (fully undetectable) crypter, primarily using Visual Basic 6, aimed at bypassing antivirus signature detection.  
- It explains crypter vs packer, runtime vs scantime crypters, and common auxiliary features like binders, EOF preservation, “antis” (anti-VM/anti-debug), and file pumping.  
- The core focus is the “stub” model: encrypting a payload, appending it to a benign stub, then decrypting/executing at runtime, and why the stub becomes the long-term detection bottleneck.  
- It discusses how AV vendors obtain samples (multi-scanners and AV telemetry/submission) and frames detection as both specific string/signature matches and broader behavioral/API-pattern signatures.  
- The author outlines a manual “pinpoint detection” workflow (iteratively removing modules/functions/lines) and a set of “universal undetection” tactics (junk code, reordering, renaming, string/API obfuscation, version info/icon changes), plus USG/stub-generator concepts for polymorphism.  
- Useful primarily for malware developers and offensive operators studying AV evasion mechanics; also relevant to defenders for understanding common obfuscation patterns and why commodity crypters churn quickly.

Technical Focus:
- Crypter architecture: stub + encrypted payload (append/EOF handling)  
- Runtime decryption/execution and RunPE-style process injection concepts  
- AV detection models: specific signatures vs broad heuristic/API-pattern signatures  
- Manual signature isolation via iterative code removal and rescanning  
- Obfuscation/polymorphism: junk code, control-flow noise, variable renaming, string/API encryption  
- USG (stub generator) and automation (“undetectors”) for generating unique builds

Use Cases:
- Building a basic crypter stub/client workflow (educational/offensive)
- Iteratively identifying which code regions trigger AV detections
- Implementing polymorphic build changes to reduce static signature hits
- Understanding how sample submission pipelines accelerate signature creation
- Defensive reverse engineering: mapping common crypter obfuscation patterns to detections
