Title:
COFFLoader (Beacon Object File / COFF Loader)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- COFFLoader is a standalone loader for COFF object files used as Cobalt Strike Beacon Object Files (BOFs), allowing operators to execute unmodified BOFs without running a Cobalt Strike agent.  
- It implements a subset of Beacon’s internal APIs via a “beacon_compatibility” layer so BOFs expecting Beacon functions can run in this harness.  
- The project includes a Python helper (beacon_generate.py) to build Beacon-compatible argument buffers (hex-encoded) for BOFs that parse parameters via BeaconDataParse/BeaconDataExtract.  
- Injection-related Beacon compatibility functions are stubbed/empty, so BOFs relying on those features won’t fully work.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers/pentesters and BOF developers to test, debug, and validate BOFs in isolation and to understand BOF argument packing and execution flow.  
- Interesting because it provides a minimal, inspectable reference implementation of BOF loading/execution and Beacon API shims outside of Cobalt Strike.

Technical Focus:
- COFF/BOF parsing and in-memory execution
- Beacon API compatibility layer (BeaconDataParse/Extract, formatting/output helpers)
- BOF argument packing/serialization (datap buffers)
- Windows x64 BOF execution workflow (go() entrypoint)
- Cross-platform build/testing harness (Makefile, test object)

Use Cases:
- Execute and test Cobalt Strike BOFs without a Beacon session
- Debug BOF argument parsing and buffer layouts using generated hex arguments
- Validate BOF behavior in a controlled harness during development
- Port/adapt BOFs to other frameworks by reusing/understanding Beacon API shims
- Build CI-style regression tests for BOFs using the included test target
