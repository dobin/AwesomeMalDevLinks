Title:
PIClin (Position Independent Code Linker)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- PIClin is a build tool that compiles C, Rust, or Zig source code into position-independent Windows shellcode (or optionally a PE), using MinGW GCC and custom linking.  
- It aims to let developers write “normal” code that calls Win32 APIs and standard C library functions without rewriting for shellcode constraints (e.g., no need for stack strings or manual API resolver stubs).  
- At link time it detects imported Win32/MSVCRT functions and generates a `winlib.c` shim that provides dynamic resolution for those APIs, currently targeting `kernel32.dll`, `ntdll.dll`, and `msvcrt.dll`.  
- The project relies on linker-script techniques to keep strings/data usable in PIC shellcode and provides a simple `loader.exe` for testing the produced `.bin`.  
- It’s useful for red teamers, exploit developers, and shellcode authors who want faster iteration from high-level source to injectable payloads, while still retaining the ability to customize OPSEC (e.g., swapping in indirect syscalls).  
- Notable limitations include assumptions about DLLs already being loaded, ad-hoc C header parsing, and Rust requiring `no_std`-style constraints to avoid standard library linking issues.

Technical Focus:
- Position-independent code (PIC) generation for Windows shellcode
- Linker scripts and custom linking with MinGW-w64 (gcc/ld)
- Automatic API import detection and generated dynamic API resolver (`winlib.c`)
- Win32 API usage from shellcode (kernel32/ntdll/msvcrt)
- Multi-language payload compilation (C, Rust, Zig)
- Shellcode vs PE output formats and test loader generation

Use Cases:
- Compile PoC payloads into raw shellcode for injection (process injection, loaders, exploit chains)
- Rapid prototyping of Win32 API–based shellcode without manual import tables
- Generating a PE variant of the same payload for easier debugging and staging
- Extending API coverage by adding DLL/function metadata via `win32-db` and `piclin/winlib.py`
- Building custom shellcode frameworks that replace the default resolver with stealthier syscall techniques
