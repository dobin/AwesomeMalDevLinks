Title:
CowSpot: Real-time Module Stomping Detection

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post describes F-Secure’s “CowSpot” approach for detecting module stomping in real time on Windows endpoints.  
- Module stomping is a defense-evasion technique where an attacker overwrites the in-memory code sections of a legitimately loaded module (DLL/EXE) to execute malicious code while blending in with trusted images.  
- The write-up focuses on how to identify tampering by correlating memory protections, section layout/permissions, and discrepancies between mapped image content and what should exist on disk (or in the original image mapping).  
- It emphasizes runtime visibility into process memory changes rather than relying only on static scanning or post-compromise forensics.  
- The content is primarily useful for Blue Teams/EDR engineers and threat hunters building detections for in-memory code injection and image tampering.  
- It’s interesting because it targets a common blind spot in user-mode telemetry: detecting “legit module present” while its executable bytes have been replaced.

Technical Focus:
- Module stomping / image section overwrite
- Windows process memory inspection (mapped images vs private memory)
- Memory protection transitions (e.g., RX/RWX changes)
- PE section characteristics and integrity validation
- Real-time detection/telemetry design for EDR

Use Cases:
- Detect in-memory payloads that hide inside legitimate DLL/EXE mappings
- Build EDR rules for suspicious image-section modifications and protection flips
- Threat hunting for stealthy code injection that avoids new module loads
- Incident response triage of processes with tampered mapped images
