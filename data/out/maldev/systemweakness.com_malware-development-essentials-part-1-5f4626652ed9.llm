Title:
Malware Development Essentials Part 1

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Introductory notes for beginner-to-intermediate Windows malware development, focusing on Windows internals fundamentals rather than a specific tool or PoC.  
- Explains Windows’ layered architecture (user mode vs kernel mode), system calls, and the role of the HAL in hardware interaction.  
- Summarizes Windows memory management concepts (virtual memory, paged/non-paged pools, page states) and common page protection flags used with memory allocation APIs.  
- Covers core exploit-mitigation concepts DEP and ASLR and why they complicate code injection/exploitation by restricting execution and randomizing memory layouts.  
- Provides a quick reference to common WinAPI calls (process/thread creation, environment queries) and key Windows DLLs (kernel32, ntdll, advapi32, ws2_32, wininet, user32).  
- Useful as a cheat-sheet style primer for malware dev learners, red teamers building implants, and defenders wanting baseline context for Windows process/memory behavior.

Technical Focus:
- Windows user-mode vs kernel-mode architecture, system calls, HAL  
- Windows virtual memory, paged/non-paged pools, page states  
- Memory protection flags (PAGE_EXECUTE_*, PAGE_READWRITE, PAGE_GUARD, etc.)  
- DEP (NX) and ASLR mitigation mechanics  
- WinAPI basics (CreateProcess, CreateThread, Sleep, GetUserName, etc.)  
- Core Windows DLL roles (kernel32/kernelbase/ntdll/advapi32/ws2_32/wininet/user32)

Use Cases:
- Building foundational knowledge for Windows implant/malware development
- Understanding constraints for shellcode execution and memory permissions (DEP/NX)
- Preparing for process injection/exploitation topics (ASLR implications, page protections)
- Quick reference for common WinAPI calls and DLL responsibilities
- Defensive context for interpreting suspicious API usage and memory protection changes
