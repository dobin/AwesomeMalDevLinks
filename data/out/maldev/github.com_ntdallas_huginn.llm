Title:
Huginn Project (Position-Independent COFF Loader Shellcode)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Huginn is a Windows x64 position-independent COFF (.o) loader that executes COFF payloads fully in-memory by appending the object file to loader shellcode (no disk drop).  
- It implements a full COFF loading pipeline: section mapping, symbol resolution (including a custom import convention), relocation handling, per-section memory protections, and calling a `go(PCOFF_INFO)` entry point.  
- The loader emphasizes evasion with stack spoofing (synthetic frames mimicking `BaseThreadInitThunk` → `RtlUserThreadStart`), indirect syscalls via HalosGate SSN resolution, and an EAF-oriented export parsing bypass using gadget-based memory reads.  
- It avoids CRT/import tables by resolving APIs at runtime via PEB-walking and compile-time hashes, and can proxy `LoadLibraryA` through threadpool/timer callbacks.  
- After execution it performs aggressive cleanup: frees all allocated regions and destroys a dedicated heap to reduce artifacts and leaks.  
- Useful for red teams, pentesters, and malware developers building BOF/COFF-style in-memory modules and experimenting with syscall/stack-walk evasion tradecraft.

Technical Focus:
- In-memory COFF object loading (sections, symbols, relocations, IAT/GOT)
- Position-independent shellcode without CRT/imports (PEB walk + hashed API resolution)
- Indirect syscalls (HalosGate SSN resolution + syscall gadget)
- Stack spoofing / synthetic call stacks (unwind info parsing, frame sizing)
- EAF-style export resolution bypass (gadget-based reads)
- Memory protection hygiene and post-exec heap/region cleanup

Use Cases:
- Execute custom COFF/BOF-like modules in-memory as shellcode
- Build loaders that reduce user-mode API telemetry via indirect syscalls
- Test/benchmark stack-walking detections against synthetic stack frames
- Develop modular payloads with runtime-resolved imports (`DLL$Function` convention)
- Create short-lived in-memory tooling with minimal residual allocations
