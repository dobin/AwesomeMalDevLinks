Title:
DLHell — Local & Remote Windows DLL Proxying (DCOM-assisted)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- DLHell is a Python tool from Synacktiv that automates crafting “proxy” DLLs and deploying them locally or to remote Windows hosts to achieve DLL hijacking/proxying.  
- It solves the operational friction of building a forwarding DLL, renaming/staging the original DLL, and placing both in a target directory so a chosen process loads the attacker-controlled proxy.  
- The tool supports remote operations over SMB (C$ admin share) and can optionally trigger execution via DCOM activation using a supplied CLSID/ProgID list (from `dcom.json`).  
- It compiles C++ proxy DLLs from a template (`template.tpe`) using MinGW-w64 toolchains and embeds a user-specified command to execute (e.g., launching a payload).  
- Authentication options mirror Impacket-style targeting, including NTLM hashes and Kerberos (ccache/AES key).  
- Useful for red teams and pentesters who already have admin-equivalent access and want repeatable DLL proxying/hijack deployment and optional DCOM-based triggering.

Technical Focus:
- Windows DLL proxying / forwarding DLL generation
- Remote DLL hijacking via SMB admin shares (C$)
- DCOM activation via CLSID/ProgID (COM/DCOM)
- Automated retrieval/renaming/staging of original DLLs
- Kerberos/NTLM authentication flows (Impacket-style)
- Cross-compilation of Windows DLLs with MinGW-w64

Use Cases:
- Automate creation of a proxy DLL that forwards exports while executing a command/payload
- Remote staging of hijacked DLL + original DLL on a Windows host via SMB (requires admin)
- Trigger execution by activating a vulnerable DCOM class (ProgID/CLSID-driven)
- Enumerate and extend known DCOM hijack targets via `dcom.json`
- Rapid testing of DLL search-order/hijack opportunities in controlled assessments
