Title:
SHAREM (Shellcode Analysis Framework)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- SHAREM is a Windows-focused shellcode analysis framework that combines emulation and a custom disassembler to analyze and deobfuscate shellcode without traditional debugging.  
- It emulates 20,000+ WinAPI functions and “virtually all” user-mode Windows syscalls, logging behavior and categorizing API/syscall activity to aid triage and reverse engineering.  
- A key capability is letting encoded shellcode deobfuscate itself during emulation, then presenting the decoded/discovered code directly in the disassembly view.  
- It supports “timeless debugging” (execution history) and “complete code coverage” to explore alternate paths and identify unreachable or hidden functionality.  
- The tool can enrich disassembly using emulation-derived context (e.g., discovered functions, structure decoding, registry extraction), and can optionally simulate or perform limited network actions (e.g., URLDownloadToFileA into memory).  
- Useful primarily for malware analysts and reverse engineers, but also valuable for red teams/pentesters validating payload behavior and for blue teams building detections from observed API/syscall traces.  
- Presented at DEFCON 31 and Black Hat Arsenal, with a companion Ghidra script (separate repo) that ingests SHAREM JSON output for Ghidra workflows.

Technical Focus:
- Windows shellcode emulation (WinAPI + user-mode syscalls)
- Automated deobfuscation via emulation (self-decoding shellcode)
- Custom disassembly with emulation-assisted annotation
- Timeless debugging / execution tracing (incl. optional stack snapshots)
- Complete code coverage / path exploration
- JSON output integration (e.g., Ghidra ingestion), structure/registry extraction

Use Cases:
- Deobfuscate and analyze encoded Windows shellcode samples safely
- Produce API/syscall traces for behavioral understanding and detection engineering
- Identify hidden branches/unreachable logic via code-coverage-style exploration
- Enrich reverse engineering in Ghidra using SHAREM-generated JSON artifacts
- Validate syscall-based techniques across Windows versions/builds (e.g., SSN/OS-build dependent behavior)
