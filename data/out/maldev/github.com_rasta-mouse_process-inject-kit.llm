Title:
Process Inject Kit (Cobalt Strike Process Inject Kit port to C++ BOF)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository ports Cobalt Strike’s Process Inject Kit from C into a C++ Beacon Object File (BOF) template.  
- It provides reference implementations of Cobalt Strike’s built-in “fork&run/spawn” and “explicit” process injection techniques, intended to be swapped out via Aggressor Script hooks.  
- The key problem it solves is enabling operators to customize or replace Cobalt Strike’s default injection behavior while keeping compatibility with CS’s injection workflow.  
- It includes BOF source code, an Aggressor script (`process-inject.cna`) that implements the `PROCESS_INJECT_SPAWN` and `PROCESS_INJECT_EXPLICIT` hooks, and a Visual Studio solution to build x86/x64 artifacts.  
- Useful primarily for red teamers and tool developers who need controlled injection tradecraft (e.g., to adjust target processes, memory allocation/write/execute patterns, or operational constraints).  
- Interesting because it exposes a practical, modifiable injection framework aligned with Cobalt Strike 4.5+ injection updates and hook-based extensibility.

Technical Focus:
- Cobalt Strike Aggressor Script resource hooks (`PROCESS_INJECT_SPAWN`, `PROCESS_INJECT_EXPLICIT`)
- Beacon Object Files (BOF) in C/C++
- Windows process injection tradecraft (spawn vs explicit injection paths)
- x86/x64 build and distribution workflow (Visual Studio solution)
- Customization of CS “fork and run” injection pipeline

Use Cases:
- Replace/modify Cobalt Strike default process injection to match an engagement’s OPSEC constraints
- Prototype and test alternative injection implementations behind CS hooks
- Build consistent x86/x64 injection modules for Beacon workflows
- Research/diff injection behavior aligned with Cobalt Strike 4.5 process injection changes
