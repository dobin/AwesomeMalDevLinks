Title:
RWX_MEMEORY_HUNT_AND_INJECTION_DV (RWX Memory Hunt and Injection)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository demonstrates a Windows shellcode injection technique that avoids creating new RWX memory by hunting for existing RWX pages inside a legitimate running process (OneDrive.exe).  
- It enumerates OneDrive.exe, opens a handle, queries its virtual memory layout, locates RWX regions, writes shellcode into an existing RWX region, and executes it.  
- Execution is performed by “forking” OneDrive.exe into a new process and setting the forked process start address to the injected shellcode, then terminating the clone after execution.  
- The approach aims to reduce common telemetry associated with VirtualAllocEx/VirtualProtect-based injection patterns.  
- It is primarily useful for red teamers and malware developers researching defense evasion and alternative injection primitives, and for blue teamers building detections around RWX page usage and process cloning/fork behaviors.  

Technical Focus:
- Remote process memory enumeration (VirtualQueryEx / memory region scanning)
- Reuse of existing RWX memory regions (no new RWX allocation)
- Shellcode writing into a remote process (WriteProcessMemory)
- Windows “fork”/process cloning API usage for execution
- Start-address manipulation / execution redirection in a cloned process
- NTDLL-based position-independent shellcode constraints

Use Cases:
- Proof-of-concept defense-evasion injection without VirtualAllocEx/VirtualProtect
- Researching detection opportunities around RWX pages in signed/benign processes (e.g., OneDrive.exe)
- Developing and testing NTDLL-based shellcode execution chains
- Building EDR analytics for suspicious RWX region reuse + remote writes + process cloning
