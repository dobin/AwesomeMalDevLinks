Title:
EarlyCascade Improved (Early Cascade Injection PoC)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository is a proof-of-concept implementation of Outflank’s “Early Cascade Injection,” a process injection technique that executes code very early in process creation, before many user-mode EDR components are initialized.  
- It works by forcing the Windows Shim engine to be enabled and then hijacking a Shim engine callback to gain execution inside the newly created process.  
- The “improved” changes over the original 0xNinjaCyclone code include selecting an arbitrary target process, loading shellcode dynamically from a file, and applying basic XOR obfuscation to reduce static shellcode detections.  
- The PoC creates a suspended process, allocates and writes a stub + shellcode, enables the shim engine, hijacks the callback, and resumes the thread to trigger execution; the stub then disables the shim engine and uses APC queuing to run the payload later.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers, pentesters, and malware researchers studying early-process injection and user-mode EDR evasion tradeoffs.  
- It’s interesting because it leverages Windows application compatibility (shim) internals as an execution primitive during a timing window that can bypass common user-mode monitoring.

Technical Focus:
- Early-process injection during process creation (suspended process workflow)
- Windows Shim engine enablement and callback hijacking
- Remote memory allocation/writes (stub + payload staging)
- APC-based deferred execution
- Dynamic API/address resolution for internal flags/callbacks
- Basic shellcode obfuscation (XOR) and file-based payload loading

Use Cases:
- EDR evasion research focused on “pre-user-mode sensor” execution windows
- Developing/validating detections for shim-engine abuse and early injection chains
- Red team tradecraft prototyping for stealthy initial code execution in a new process
- Studying Windows application compatibility (shim) internals and callback surfaces
