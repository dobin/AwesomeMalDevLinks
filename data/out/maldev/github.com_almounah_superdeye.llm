Title:
SuperdEye — Indirect Syscalls (HellHall/TartarusGate) in Pure Go

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- SuperdEye is a Go + Go-assembler implementation of HellHall (a revised TartarusGate approach) to perform indirect Windows syscalls.  
- It targets the problem of user-mode AV/EDR hooks in `ntdll.dll` by scanning for hooked stubs and recovering the correct System Service Number (SSN) for a desired `Nt*` function.  
- If the target stub is hooked, it searches neighboring syscall stubs above/below to find a clean pattern and infer the SSN, then builds an indirect syscall invocation.  
- The library exposes a generic `SuperdSyscall` interface and also provides wrapper functions for some syscalls to resemble `golang.org/x/sys/windows` usage.  
- It’s primarily useful for red team operators, implant/tooling developers, and researchers experimenting with syscall-based evasion and Windows internals.  
- Interesting because it brings HellHall/TartarusGate-style SSN recovery and indirect syscalls into a relatively portable Go package, comparable to BananaPhone (more direct/limited neighbor search) and Acheron (address-order SSN deduction).

Technical Focus:
- NTDLL user-mode hook detection and stub scanning
- SSN (syscall number) recovery via neighbor scanning (TartarusGate/HellHall)
- Indirect syscall invocation (syscall trampoline/stub)
- Go + Go assembler low-level Windows interop
- `Nt*` syscall wrappers aligned with `golang.org/x/sys/windows`

Use Cases:
- Building Go-based loaders/implants that avoid calling hooked `ntdll` exports directly
- Researching and prototyping syscall evasion techniques against user-mode EDR hooks
- Implementing stealthier process injection primitives (e.g., `NtAllocateVirtualMemory`, `NtCreateThreadEx`)
- Comparing HellGate/HellHall/TartarusGate-style approaches with other Go syscall projects
