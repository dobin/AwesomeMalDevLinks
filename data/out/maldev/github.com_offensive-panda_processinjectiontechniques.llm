Title:
Process Injection Series (ProcessInjectionTechniques)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository is a curated “process injection series” that documents and implements many Windows process injection and execution techniques commonly used by malware and red teams.  
- It aims to centralize step-by-step explanations, source code, and demos for a wide range of TTPs under MITRE ATT&CK T1055.  
- Covered methods span classic remote thread injection and DLL injection through more evasive approaches like process hollowing/ghosting, module stomping, APC/EarlyBird, thread hijacking, and fiber-based execution.  
- It also includes lower-level tradecraft such as NTAPI-based injection, NTDLL unhooking (“Lagos Island”), PEB-walking for API resolution/obfuscation, and direct/indirect syscalls (SysWhispers-style) to reduce userland hooking visibility.  
- The examples use a consistent demo shellcode payload (MessageBox) to make technique comparison easier.  
- Useful primarily for red teamers, pentesters, and malware researchers; secondarily for blue teams building detections by understanding implementation details and API/behavioral footprints.

Technical Focus:
- Windows process injection patterns (local/remote, thread creation, APC, hijacking)
- Memory allocation/protection and RWX tradeoffs (VirtualAlloc/VirtualProtect, RWX hunting)
- PE/loader manipulation (process hollowing, PE injection, entrypoint patching)
- Section mapping injection (NtCreateSection/NtMapViewOfSection)
- Evasion primitives (NTDLL unhooking, API obfuscation, PEB walking)
- Direct and indirect syscalls (bypassing userland hooks)

Use Cases:
- Build and test multiple injection variants for red team payload delivery
- Compare detection surface across injection techniques (API calls, memory perms, thread behavior)
- Develop/validate EDR bypass hypotheses (syscalls, unhooking, API resolution tricks)
- Create lab exercises or workshops on Windows injection internals
- Generate defensive analytics for suspicious memory mappings, thread starts, and module tampering
