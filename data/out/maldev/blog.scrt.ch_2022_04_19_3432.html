<p>Previous blog posts addressed the issue of static artefacts that can easily be caught by security software, such as strings and API imports:</p>

<p>This one provides an additional layer of obfuscation to target another kind of detection mechanism used to monitor a program’s activity, i.e userland hooks. </p>

<p>It comes with two additional niceties:</p>

<li>A multithreaded Python script to obfuscate the entire Meterpreter codebase.</li>



<li>A self-contained, position independent C source code to dynamically fetch syscalls numbers on Windows.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-note-on-the-state-of-the-art-of-userland-hooks-evasion">A note on the State-of-the-Art of userland hooks evasion</h2>



<p>&lt;storytime&gt;Our research on the subject started in 2017 as part of two externalised school semester projects. Some years before that, there already were some noise about some new antivirus able to detect “any threat” pre-execution, using “IA” and even apparently without the need of regular updates. Two fellow students at the time, having similar research projects, could not circumvent it. At around the same time, a friend working in an IT company invited me to a private demo of the software, where the salesman confidently asked me to throw things at it, and indeed I could not go past it 🙂</p>



<p>It is in 2017 that I encountered the software as part of a thesis, and this time I decided to stop jerking around and I reverse-engineered two thirds of the damn antivirus. This taught me about userland hooking, which I initially thought that no company in their right mind would ever do, but hey, who am I to judge.</p>



<p>About 6 months later I gave SCRT a full bypass of this software’s capabilities, alongside two self-protection bypasses to disable the antivirus in case it would ever be needed.&lt;/storytime&gt;</p>



<p>In the meantime, many articles and tools were published on the subject and some work quite well. In any case, ours is only a bit different since we use a C/C++ source code obfuscator. And, because the public research on the subject is advanced enough, we don’t see any issue anymore by sharing it. Like all techniques, it comes with its pros and cons.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pros and cons</h3>



<p>The advantages are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>No hardcoded syscalls numbers</li>



<li>No check against Windows’ version</li>



<li>Generic accross AV/EDR.</li>



<li>Able to, for instance, refactor a <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="typ">CreateRemoteThread</span></code> call into a <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="typ">NtCreateThreadEx</span></code> one, which does not have the same number or even order of parameters.</li>



<li>Integrates well with other obfuscation passes, since all of it is made by the same software, with the same technologies.</li>



<li>Thread-safe.</li>
</ul>



<p>The downside are as follows:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Need to have the Windows headers somewhere on disk :p</li>



<li>Some disadvantages are specific to the way we get syscall numbers, but that actual implementation can be swapped easily for another one. These disadvantages are:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Read <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">ntdll</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">dll</span></code> from disk.</li>



<li>Need to get the type definition from MSDN in case you want to add support for another syscall.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Reading <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">ntdll</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">dll</span></code> from disk is seen as suboptimal in recent publications, with the arguments that it can “easily” be detected by antivirus since <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">ntdll</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">dll</span></code> is loaded into every process already and there is no “legit” need to do it again.</p>



<p>However, we’ve used this tool for 4 years now (at the time of writing) without any issue. Having ideas about what antivirus or blue teams should do is one thing, actually implementing it without false positives is quite another. Would that even be the case, we would attempt to bypass the <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">ntdll</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">dll</span></code> read detection, since NTFS is the PHP of fileystems. </p>



<p>As for the type definitions, it has been automated in other tools so their implementation could probably be integrated (<a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/09/flare-ida-pro-script-series-msdn-annotations-ida-pro-for-malware-analysis.html">https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/09/flare-ida-pro-script-series-msdn-annotations-ida-pro-for-malware-analysis.html</a>).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Other tools</h3>



<p>Other than that, here are some other popular tools that also fight userland hooks:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://github.com/jthuraisamy/SysWhispers2">SysWhisper2</a></li>



<li><a href="https://github.com/crummie5/FreshyCalls">FreshyCalls</a></li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Evading userland hooks with raw syscalls</h3>



<p>There are many techniques to go around userland hooks and we won’t provide yet another summary of each of these. Our approach, like many others, work by invoking syscalls. To do that, one needs the syscall number, which is specific to each version of Windows as opposed to syscalls on Unix.</p>



<p>There are many techniques to recover these syscall numbers:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Hardcode them.</li>



<li>Parse them from <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">ntdll</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">dll</span></code>.</li>



<li>Bruteforce: since <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">ntoskrnl</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">exe</span></code> checks syscalls arguments and returns the error “<em>INVALID_PARAMETERS</em>“, one can leverage that as an Oracle and iterate over the syscall number until arguments are valid.</li>



<li>Somehow get them from the hooked <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">ntdll</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">dll</span></code> in the process address space, which implies to detect and resolve hooks, which requires a disassembler which in turn increases our footprint. </li>



<li>Sort the <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">ntdll</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">dll</span></code>’s EAT by name like shown in <a href="https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2020/12/bypassing-user-mode-hooks-and-direct-invocation-of-system-calls-for-red-teams/">https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2020/12/bypassing-user-mode-hooks-and-direct-invocation-of-system-calls-for-red-teams/</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>The last one is probably the simplest. In any case, here is the implementation details behind the technique used in <em>avcleaner</em>, which you can easily swap for the one you prefer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-clang-obfuscation-pass">Get syscall numbers</h2>



<p>The code shown in the subsequent section is written in such a way because it’s meant to be position independent.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="get-ntdll.dlls-export-directory">Get <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">ntdll</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">dll</span></code>’s export directory</h3>



<p>Once the file is loaded into memory, one must locate the implementation of the API of interest. For instance, one can expect to find <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="typ">NtCreateThreadEx</span></code> somewhere in the <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">text</span></code> section, but its address is not predictible because of ASLR. However, <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">ntdll</span></code> being a library, it actually exposes this API and many others, so that software can reuse them. The collection of exposed API is stored inside the <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="typ">Export</span><span class="pln"> directory</span></code> in a PE file. Each API is identified either by its name or an identifier called “Ordinal”. To reduce the footprint, it is arguably better to locate the API by ordinal. On the other hand, they are not guaranteed to stay the same accross Windows versions. Either way, here is how one would locate the export directory of a DLL:</p>

<p>From there the sky is the limit, as they are many ways to collect the syscall ID. The example below, which obviously does not care about efficiency, only proceeds in case the syscall corresponds to an API we want to obfuscate.

<p>Here, the syscall number is <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="lit">0x55</span></code> (<code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">mov eax</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">55h</span></code>). Since every syscall is implemented in the same manner, the offset to this assembly instruction is always the same for every API. The offset is thus the number of bytes between <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="typ">NtCreateFile</span></code>’s prologue and the operand of <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">mov</span></code>: 4 bytes (as can be seen by counting the bytes in the second column above).</p>

<p>This is a simple proof-of-concept that does the job, but with lots of imperfection. For instance, notice the <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">strequal</span></code> call, which uses API names as strings. This is a challenge for position independent code but also for antivirus detection, since strings are easy to find in binaries. Moreover, Windows Defender actually flags that with a low-score signature called “ApiRetrieval”, but in case everything else in your payload is well designed, it won’t bother flagging the file as malicious. That’s the reason it’s more standard to use API hashes, but unless the API hashing algorithm is itself polymorphic, the same problem might arise. Besides, string encryption would definitely be a valid alternative. Either way, we won’t provide any of that, since the goal is to document techniques, not provide perfect tools ready to pwn systems.</p>



<p>Since disassembling other syscalls shows that every syscall follows the same implementation save for the syscall number, we can safely define the following template and update the syscall number once we have it:</p>

<p>The memory area is set to RXW to bypass Data Execution Prevention (DEP). Some say it’s a detection vector but we never actually triggered an AV by doing that. In any case, if that bothers you, don’t hesitate to insert a <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="typ">VirtualProtect</span></code> call or locate a code cave with existing RWX permissions.</p>



<p>Another detection vector would be the <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">syscall_shellcode</span></code> variable, since it will hold <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="lit">0x0f</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">0x05</span></code>, which could be detected by some YARA rules looking for direct syscalls. Encryption is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Clang obfuscation pass</h3>



<p>The previous blog posts went into (lengthy) details about implementing an obfuscation pass with libclang. I think it is no necessary to do so here since no new concept is introduced. However, here is how simple it is to define a rule to transform one API call to a syscall, even if they don’t share the same number of arguments:</p>

<p>Of course, for that to be possible, the obfuscation rule must know about the arguments and how to handle them, and the lines below simply take care of it:</p>

<p>An interesting bug I encountered while obfuscating meterpreter was API calls within if-statements, because the API call’s return value is used as a condition for executing another code block. However, Windows being Windows, syscall don’t return the same value in case of error / success and we must actually check against the macro <em>ERROR_SUCCESS</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="example-with-meterpreter">Example with Meterpreter</h2>



<p>Accompanying this blog post’s release, there is a python script that bootstraps <em>avcleaner</em> and makes it easy to obfuscate a whole codebase at once. Of course you could just <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pun">**</span><span class="com">/*.c | xargs avcleaner</span></code> away but it brings some useful features:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Statistics: <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">avcleaner</span></code>’s output is quite lengthy and sometimes, when working on a huge codebase, critical failures could be overlooked.</li>



<li>Multithreading / multiprocessing: depending on your Python implementation, you can switch between them with 1 line of code at the top of the script and get the most performance. This allows to cut down execution time from ~30 minutes to ~30 seconds in the case of Meterpreter.</li>



<li>Some files are opted out of the obfuscation pass because they contain some weird code patterns that can’t be handled correctly by <code class=" prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">avcleaner</span></code>, and since our research time is limited, we decided to conveniently skip these files. </li>



<li>Moreover, the statistics printed out at the end of the obfuscation pass should be regarded as an estimation, since the total number of “<em>CreateRemoteThread</em>” for instance is counted with pattern matching Python-side, which obviously makes mistakes by accounting for occurrences in comments or something like that.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Script</h3>



<p>Here is a script that automates patching Meterpreter and cross-compiles it. This is possible since MSF 6 with the introduction of makefiles and dockerfiles allowing cross-compilation from any OS to Windows x86/x64 architectures.</p>

<p>Note: this only provides the antivirus detection status with the static engine, to test the hooks and the memory scans you have to go real-mode.</p>



<p>Of course, while we do have a clean detection score in the console output above, you probably won’t have the same results unless you customised your <em>ReflectiveLoader</em> to not use the same ROT13 API hashes as the default one.</p>



<p>I think it really is a game changer to be able to test that rapidly a full chain like this: obfuscation, compilation and antivirus testing on the same machine, as part of a single script.</p>
