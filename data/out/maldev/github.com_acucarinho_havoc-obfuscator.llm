Title:
havoc-obfuscator

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- A shell script that automates rebranding/obfuscation changes to the Havoc C2 framework to reduce static detections and make network/service artifacts look less “Havoc-like.”  
- It focuses on modifying HTTP behavior and UI/command naming to evade AV/EDR signatures and C2 hunting based on default indicators.  
- Techniques include IIS 8.5 impersonation (including removing the `X-Havoc: True` header), serving a fake IIS-style page instead of a 404/empty response, and refactoring/renaming built-in command strings (e.g., `Shell` → `MiniMice`, `DotRunner` → `miniMiceDot`) across teamserver, client, and payloads.  
- It also documents operational notes like using malleable profiles (e.g., windows-update), avoiding default ports, and using redirectors/proxies to mitigate fingerprinting (e.g., JARM).  
- Useful primarily for red teams/pentesters running Havoc infrastructure and for defenders to understand common “rebrand and blend-in” modifications applied to open-source C2s.

Technical Focus:
- Havoc C2 codebase refactoring and string/command renaming
- HTTP header manipulation and server fingerprint impersonation (IIS 8.5)
- Handling redirect/404 behavior to mimic legitimate web servers
- Malleable C2 profiles (YAOTL) and traffic shaping
- Fingerprinting evasion considerations (JARM, certificates, redirectors)

Use Cases:
- Rebrand Havoc deployments to reduce default IoCs and signature hits
- Make Havoc teamserver responses resemble Microsoft IIS behavior
- Patch/adjust Havoc’s redirect handling to avoid anomalous 404/zero-length responses
- Standardize renamed operator commands across client/teamserver/payloads
- Prepare C2 infrastructure for use behind redirectors/proxies
