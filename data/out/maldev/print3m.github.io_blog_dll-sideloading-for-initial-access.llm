Title:
DLL Sideloading for Initial Access – Red Team Operator's Guide

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post explains how to use DLL sideloading as an initial access technique by packaging a legitimate, digitally signed Windows application together with a malicious replacement DLL.  
- It focuses on selecting “trusted” software that still runs when moved off its installed path, then swapping a custom application DLL (not a system DLL) to execute attacker code while preserving normal functionality.  
- The guide distinguishes DLL sideloading from DLL proxying and shows how proxy DLLs can forward exports to the original library to avoid breaking the app and reduce obvious indicators.  
- It demonstrates practical discovery of load behavior using Sysinternals Process Monitor and optional PE inspection to identify candidate DLLs and when they load.  
- A worked example with Notepad++ uses the author’s DllShimmer tool to generate a C++ proxy project from the original DLL’s export table, add payload logic to a chosen exported function, and fix common path-resolution pitfalls.  
- OPSEC sections cover tradeoffs like avoiding DllMain for payload execution, risks of LOLBIN relocation detections, delivery via archives/LNKs, and metadata/signing considerations for the proxy DLL.  

Technical Focus:
- DLL search order abuse via relative-path loading (LoadLibrary)  
- DLL proxying via export forwarding / EAT parity  
- Sysinternals Procmon “Load Image” tracing for DLL load mapping  
- PE export table parsing and proxy stub generation (DllShimmer)  
- Initial access packaging (archive + LNK) and execution flow control (mutex/one-shot)  
- OPSEC: LOLBIN relocation detection, signing, and build/metadata hygiene  

Use Cases:
- Crafting initial-access lures that execute payloads through trusted signed applications
- Building functional proxy DLLs that preserve application behavior while running implant code
- Rapidly enumerating and validating sideloadable DLL candidates in third-party software
- Testing defensive detections around unusual module loads, relocated binaries, and proxy DLL artifacts
