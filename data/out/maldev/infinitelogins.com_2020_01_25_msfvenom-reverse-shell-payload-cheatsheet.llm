Title:
MSFVenom Reverse Shell Payload Cheatsheet (with & without Meterpreter)

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post is a compact cheatsheet of `msfvenom` commands to generate reverse shell payloads across multiple platforms and formats.  
- It focuses on both Meterpreter and non-Meterpreter payloads, addressing a common gap in other cheatsheets that only cover Meterpreter.  
- It distinguishes staged vs stageless payloads and provides ready-to-run examples for Windows and Linux binaries, plus common web payload formats (ASP, JSP/WAR, PHP).  
- The primary value is quick payload generation for labs and exams (explicitly OSCP-oriented), where non-Meterpreter shells are often required.  
- A practical note highlights that redirecting `msfvenom` output in PowerShell can corrupt PE output, recommending `cmd.exe` for Windows payload generation.

Technical Focus:
- Metasploit Framework `msfvenom` payload generation
- Reverse TCP shells (Meterpreter vs standard shell)
- Staged vs stageless payload architecture
- Cross-platform payload formats (EXE, ELF, ASP, JSP, WAR, PHP)
- LHOST/LPORT configuration and output formatting (`-f`, redirection)

Use Cases:
- Generate Windows EXE reverse shells for initial access in lab environments
- Create Linux ELF reverse shells for post-exploitation footholds
- Produce webshell-style reverse payloads for vulnerable web app upload/RCE paths
- Quickly switch between Meterpreter and non-Meterpreter payloads for exam constraints
- Validate payload generation workflow on Windows (cmd.exe vs PowerShell redirection)
