Title:
Proxy-Function-Calls-For-ETwTI

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository provides a small C/ASM proof-of-concept that “proxies” Windows API calls to influence what Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE/MDATP) sees in ETW Threat Intelligence (ETwTI) stack traces.  
- It focuses on hiding or obfuscating the call stack attribution for sensitive operations (notably memory allocation patterns) that are commonly surfaced via ETW/ETwTI-based telemetry.  
- The implementation uses an assembly helper to perform indirect/proxied invocation so the recorded stack frames differ from straightforward direct calls (per the referenced Dark Vortex research).  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers, pentesters, and malware developers studying EDR telemetry evasion and how stack-walking-based detections can be degraded.  
- It’s interesting because it demonstrates a practical, low-level method to manipulate stack-trace visibility without necessarily patching ETW providers, highlighting a detection gap for stack-based heuristics.

Technical Focus:
- ETW Threat Intelligence (ETwTI) telemetry and stack tracing
- Call stack spoofing / stack trace manipulation via proxy calls
- Indirect syscalls vs indirect API invocation tradeoffs
- Windows memory allocation telemetry (e.g., VirtualAlloc-family patterns)
- x64 Windows calling conventions and assembly stubs

Use Cases:
- Build PoCs to test how MDE/ETwTI attributes memory allocations to modules/functions
- Evaluate robustness of stack-walk-based detections in EDR products
- Develop/compare evasion primitives (proxy calls vs ETW patching vs direct syscalls)
- Create defensive test cases to validate detections for suspicious allocation chains
