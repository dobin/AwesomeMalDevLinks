GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
BOAZ is a Windows-focused evasion framework/packer that generates polymorphic PE/DLL/CPL outputs from x64 PE files or raw payloads, aiming to bypass signature, heuristic, and behavioral detections across AV/EDR products. It provides a “defense-in-depth but offensive” layered pipeline combining payload/PIC conversion (e.g., Donut/PE2SH/Stardust), multiple encoders/encryptors, LLVM IR obfuscation (Pluto/Akira), and extensive loader/process-injection templates. The project emphasizes syscall-centric execution (direct/indirect syscalls, Halo’s Gate/TartarusGate), API unhooking, call-stack spoofing/proxy syscalls, and “threadless” execution primitives using VEH/VCH, page guards, and vtable-pointer based techniques. It also includes ETW bypass options (patching and a patchless HWBP+VEH redirection approach), anti-emulation checks, sleep/stack encryption, entropy reduction, signing/metadata cloning, and post-execution anti-forensics/self-deletion. BOAZ is primarily useful for red teams, pentesters, and offensive security researchers evaluating EDR resilience and testing detection coverage; defenders can use it to understand modern evasion tradecraft and build detections around behaviors rather than static indicators. It’s notable for the breadth of modular evasion combinations and the large catalog of loader variants targeting memory scanning and userland hooking.

Technical Focus:
- Multi-layered AV/EDR evasion pipeline (signature/heuristic/behavioral)
- PIC/shellcode generation and payload encoding/encryption (Donut, PE2SH, Stardust; AES/RC4/DES/ChaCha20, UUID/MAC/IP encodings)
- Process injection & code execution loaders (APC, remote/local injection, thread hijacking, DLL overloading, threadless primitives)
- Syscall evasion and unhooking (direct/indirect syscalls, Halo’s Gate/TartarusGate, hook detection, custom call stacks)
- ETW bypass (NtTraceEvent patching and patchless VEH/HWBP-based bypass)
- Anti-forensics and trace removal (AmCache/ShimCache cleanup, registry timestamp tampering, self-deletion)

Use Cases:
- Generate obfuscated/encoded Windows payload wrappers for controlled red-team simulations
- Compare AV/EDR detection efficacy across different loader + obfuscation + encoding combinations
- Prototype and test syscall-based injection and hook-evasion techniques in a repeatable framework
- Build DLL/CPL sideloading artifacts for execution-chain testing (rundll32/control.exe)
- Research ETW bypass tradeoffs (patching vs patchless) and memory-scanner evasion patterns
