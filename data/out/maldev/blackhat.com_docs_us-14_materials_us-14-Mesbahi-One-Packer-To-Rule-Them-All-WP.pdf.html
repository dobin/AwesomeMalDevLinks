<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Lately, many popular Antivirus solutions claim to be the most effective against unknown and obfuscated malware. Most of these solutions are rather vague about how they supposedly achieve this goal, making it hard for end-users to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of the different products on the market. This whitepaper presents empirically discovered results on the various implementations of these methods per solution, which reveal that some Antivirus solutions have more mature methods to detect x86 malware than others, but all of them are lagging behind when it comes to x64 malware. In general, at most three stages were identified in the detection process: Static detection, Code Emulation detection (before execution) and Runtime detection (during execution). New generic evasion techniques are presented for each of these stages. These techniques were implemented by an advanced, dedicated packer, which is an approach commonly taken by malware developers to evade detection of their malicious toolset. Two brand new packing methods were developed for this cause. By combining several evasion techniques, real-world malicious executables with a high detection rate were rendered completely undetected to the prying eyes of Antivirus products.</p>
<p>Keywords: antivirus, packer, emulation, signature, heuristics, evasion</p>
<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
<p>Antivirus solutions are regularly compared with each other by various independent studies. Most of the published comparison tests so far are a combination of detection rate of known malware samples (1,3,4,5), false positives percentage (3,4,5), definitions update frequency (1,3), market share (2), usability (5), performance (3,5) and price (1,5), or minor variations of these. Not surprisingly, the results of these tests differ greatly, since they are based on unrelated criteria.</p>
<p>All of the aforementioned are relevant as comparison metrics to some extent, but they do not fully cover the whole functionality spectrum of Antivirus products. More specifically, a lot of newer detection techniques generally referred to as heuristics are left uncovered in these tests, whilst they are becoming increasingly more important to protect end-users from current and evolving cyber threats.</p>
<p>In general, at most three stages were identified in the detection process of Antivirus solutions, two of which are performed before actually executing the sample and one that is being performed during execution. The very first phase is static detection, a well-known method already in use by all popular solutions for a long time. This includes the detection of packers. The second phase involves running the executable in an emulated environment and monitoring its results. This is different from the approach that Sandbox solutions such as the open-source Cuckoo Sandbox takes to analyze and detect malware, as they really use instrumentation, rather than emulation. Last but not least, some Antivirus solutions were found to implement dynamic techniques to identify suspicious behavior while the malware is executing on the system.</p>
<p>In order to identify the product-specific detection techniques, an onion layer evasion approach was taken: first, static detection evasion was circumvented by implementing our own undetected dedicated packer, which uses two brand new techniques to evade common packer Antivirus detection. Its design is presented in Section 2. The packer’s special design allowed detection, comparison and circumvention of the different detection techniques of Antivirus products. These results are presented in Section 3. Section 4 concludes this paper.</p>
<p>The following Antivirus products were subject to the presented research:</p>
<p>● McAfee Antivirus Plus 2014 ● Norton Antivirus ● Microsoft Security Essentials ● Kaspersky Antivirus 2014 ● F-Secure Antivirus 2014 Sophos Endpoint Security 10.3 ● AVG Antivirus 2014 ● Avast! Pro Antivirus 2014 ● ESET NOD32 Antivirus 7 ● Qihoo 360 Internet Security ● BitDefender Antivirus Plus Trend Micro Titanium Antivirus+</p>
<h1>2. Packer design</h1>
<p>A packer is a tool that can transform an executable into another executable which exhibits the same or extended functionality but has a different footprint on the file system where it resides. Currently, existing real-world packers have been developed for mainly two reasons. First of all to reduce the size of the executable by compressing data and uncompressing it on the fly during execution. These packers are also often referred to as compressors, and were very popular in the early days of personal computers, when the size of executable was far more important. Some famous examples are UPX, FSG, PECompact, MEW, MPRESS, UPack and FastPack. Second of all, some packers were developed to make reverse engineering executables significantly more difficult. These packers are also often referred to as protectors, as they attempt to protect the original executable from prying eyes. They use obscure methods to prevent straightforward analysis of the executable, often by dynamically detecting common analysis tools such as debuggers in various ways. These protectors are still quite popular to protect especially the licensing scheme implementation of commercial tools and games which are known to be targeted by crackers for their popularity. Some famous examples are PELock, PESpin, SoftwarePassport (Armadillo), Thermida and VMProtect.</p>
<p>The fact that packers change the footprint on disk and thus often mitigate static Antivirus detection techniques based on signatures as a side-effect, has already been discovered and exploited for a long time by malware writers to render their malicious tools undetected (6,7,8). The packer presented in this paper was built with purely this goal in mind: evasion of Antivirus detection methods. However, the packer also supports evading other Antivirus detection methods next to static (signature) detection, which will be discussed in more details in Section 3 of this whitepaper. The packer only supports packing of windows executables, as most malware is written to be deployed on this operating system. It can transform both $\boldsymbol { \times } 8 6$ and x64 windows executables, which is not so common in the packer-world.</p>
<p>All packers have at least one thing in common: they need to introduce some code in the original executable, in order to undo the changes they performed while changing the original file’s footprint on the file system (decompressing, decoding …). The introduced code is commonly referred to as the packer’s stub. Usually, this stub is executed at the very beginning during execution time of the packed entity, which requires hijacking the execution flow of the original file. In order to understand how packers can alter original files, introduce their stub and hijack execution flow, one must understand Windows’ executables internals: the Portable Executable or PE $( \times 8 6 )$ and $\mathsf { P E } + ( { \mathsf { x } } 6 4 )$ file formats (9). The PE file format is described in the first subsection below. Hereafter, the stub of the presented packer is presented. Finally, the different methods that were developed to covertly inject the stub into the packed executables are discussed. Throughout this section, the compiled version of the following simple HelloWorld $\mathsf { C } { + + }$ file will be used to give some practical examples:</p>
<h1>Source 1: MessageBox HelloWorld Source Code</h1>
<p>Visual Studio 2012 with static linking option enabled was used to compile the final x86 and x64 HelloWorld Release configuration executables.</p>
<h1>2.1. $\mathsf { P E } ( + )$ overview</h1>
<p>Windows requires that executables have a specific file format, in order to be eligible for loading and execution by the Windows operating system. This file format describes the prerequisites required by the windows PE Loader in order to load the executable into memory as a process and successfully start execution of it. To understand how packers go about encrypting data, adding arbitrary code and hijacking execution flow, one must understand this file format first. Since Antivirus solutions also know that packers are often used to evade detection, they proactively attempt to detect deviations from the PE file format, which are often caused by imprudent packers. The PE file format exhibits the following high-level structure:</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/2ac1d6f499fb400dc5a5104935f497a9ac8525cc2fe2c1d782b17771262da41e.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 1: PE file high-level structure - source Corkami (10)</p>
<p>Two high-level parts can be dissected: the executable’s header and the executable’s sections. The header contains metadata about the executable and describes the different sections. Sections are basically ordinary collections of bytes placed in a certain order by the compiler. The bulk of the file is made up out of the raw section data, so packers usually compress and/or encrypt mainly parts of this data, but in order to do this, the header must be fully understood, as it enforces a number of restrictions on what can easily be modified, and what can’t. Next sections will focus on PE in the overview below, since $\mathsf { P E + }$ only differs on a few fields from the x86 PE format but doesn’t influence the general findings. It is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<h1>2.1.1 Executable Header</h1>
<p>The executable’s header consists of several subsections, as shown in the figure below:</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/f6f92bd5db2cba97e3b7b5bc7354a900c06a55ead415efc359ddacfaf24d8f66.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 2: PE header high-level structure - source Corkami (10)</p>
<h1>2.1.1.1. DOS Header</h1>
<p>The DOS header is a remaining from the old DOS MZ EXE format and is maintained for backwards compatibility. The first two bytes of the DOS header correspond to the ‘e_magic’ field which must be equal to “MZ”.</p>
<p>After the DOS header lays the DOS stub which contains the code that will be executed when the executable is ran in a DOS environment. For PE files, the default DOS stub added by modern compilers prints “This program cannot be run in DOS mode”, modern windows OS versions will by default ignore this stub and only verify the preamble “MZ” and the offset to the PE header, Antivirus solutions were found to flag executables which did not have this DOS stub as it deviates from normal compiler behavior. Other tools like PE Studio mark this as suspicious (note the 8/50 detection rate on VirusTotal):</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/f65525492ce8f7a46e8656ffba0c0e4856d1a969fc60e39ffcae12593531fb2b.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 3: PeStudio anomaly indicators</p>
<p>The PE header, often referred to as NT Header as well, also starts with a static signature value equal to “PE”. It is also explicitly verified by the windows PE loader before loading the executable in memory. Hereafter two subsections follow: “File Header” and “Optional Header”, the former contains the following field:</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/d395d2bf9238c4fb74ec591ec0ed20eb90876bda99996c72201dbc4a5041d10e.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 4: File Header attributes - CFF Explorer</p>
<p>The only fields of this structure that were found to have an influence on Antivirus detection rates were the TimeDateStamp, the PointerToSymbolTable and NumberOfSymbols fields. If TimeDateStamp contains an unrealistic timestamp value (e.g. in the future), or PointerToSymbolTable or NumberOfSymbols doesn’t contain zero as prescribed in the PE specification (9), some Antivirus flag the executable as suspicious.</p>
<h1>2.1.1.3. Optional Header</h1>
<p>The second subsection of the NT Header is the Optional Header. This is a big structure which contains a lot of redundant or aggregated information from the section table (equal to section headers), the last subsection of the executable’s header (discussed further below).</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/f27f2c43f6b614b63832db8105003db271b5db549102d043dc6dde17cb11f843.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 5: Optional Header attributes - CFF Explorer</p>
<p>The SizeOfCode, SizeOfInitializedDate, SizeOfUnitiliaizedData, BaseOfCode and BaseOfData are directly related to information found in the section table at the very end of the executable’s header metadata. If there is any inconsistency between these two sources, several Antivirus solutions raise flags. One of the most important field in this structure is AddressOfEntryPoint. It contains the offset to the entry point of the executable, where the PE loader will start execution of the process. It is often modified in order to hijack execution, which also opens up a detection vector. This is discussed more in depth later in this section.</p>
<p>The Optional Header also has one subsection, the Data Directories. This is actually a table of offsets to actual data in the executable’s section region, similar to the AddressOfEntryPoint. These parameters point to specific data structures related to the designated directory. The Optional Header of the x86 HelloWorld example holds the following values:</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/366f9dcf5c68950d264b988e7c8e2cf47f6ca918e1d97482d8eb706deaa9778e.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 6: Data Directory Header attributes - CFF Explorer</p>
<p>Six out of 16 directories have been filled in. It is very important to note that some of these offsets are utilized by the windows PE loader before executing the actual process, and must point to valid, unencrypted directory-specific structures on disk. Other offsets may only be used during execution time by certain windows APIs to locate data in memory, which implies that the packer must make sure the pointers are valid only when launching the original executable in memory; for example, certain APIs that load resources from an executable such as FindResource (11) and LoadString (12) will consume the Resource Directory Relative Virtual Address (RVA) offset in the PE Data Directory header in order to reach and navigate the structure where pointers to all resources of the executable are maintained. Additionally, some of these directories are only present to give some extra information, such as the Debug Directory, and can be removed without causing any harm. The whole executable’s header is loaded into memory, along with the section data, so the program can access these offsets during execution time as well.</p>
<p>The most important entries in this table for packers are the import directory and Import Address Table (IAT), which are closely related. The import directory references a structure that lists the functions of external DLLs on which the executable relies (e.g. Kernel32.DLL, USER32.DLL and NTDLL.DLL for common Windows APIs). It’s the task of the Windows PE loader to enumerate all these libraries, load them in the process its address space, and locate the address of the necessary functions before starting the process. The program expects the addresses of these functions to be present in the IAT in memory when starting execution, so this is where the PE loader must hotpatch them. In the case of the Import Directory and the IAT, we must keep in mind that the PE Loader will read them before executing the process and hence, the data they must contain valid, unencrypted structures, or else the process won’t load. The simple HelloWorld program has one specific import, namely the ‘MessageBox’ function in USER32.DLL:</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/8363db9d7a3d8e031193097c314f35209472ef5725dbb0f3ca5e075c52a18c89.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 7: Imported API - CFF Explorer</p>
<h1>2.1.1.5. Section table</h1>
<p>Last but not least, there is a section table in the executable’s header which describes the body of the executable. Here is the section table of the x86 HelloWorld program:</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/a9798eb576b4838b868f4f36245a2c26c212c14e112773aa7f056dc3db48a6c4.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 8: Section table - CFF Explorer</p>
<p>This sample executable has five distinct sections, each with a unique name and a bunch of attributes. The division of the data into sections is based on the functionality of its contents; the “.text” section contains the code of the program that will be executed; the “.rdata” section contains technical metadata generated by the compiler, mostly Data Directory-specific structures such as Debugging information, Load Configuration, Import Table and Import Address Table; the “.data” section contains static data from source code, such as hard-coded strings; the “.rsrc” section contains additional resources of the executable, such as bitmap icons and version information; finally, there is a “.reloc” section specific for the Data Directory-specific Relocation Table structure, necessary by the windows PE loader to relocate executables in memory (ASLR). The names of these sections are decided upon by the compiler who created the executable. Some compilers use slightly other naming conventions (.text with .code, .rdata with .idata), but overall, the combinations are very limited, which is already one property of the section table which some Antivirus products watch closely.</p>
<p>Additionally, each section has a set of characteristics specific for its purpose. Characteristics encompass permissions (executable, readable, writeable), as well as information about the contents of the section (code, initialized, uninitialized data). This is the duplicated information in the Optional Header which we referred to earlier. The characteristics are well-defined for executables compiled with modern compilers. Normally the first section contains code and is executable and readable, but not writeable. Other assumptions about permissions can be made roughly for all other sections, so when Antiviruses identify a PE file where all sections are readable, writeable and executable, some raise suspicion:</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/bb56907a1036ac9f71b74468efe0edabb1e77a98ea11c7222b543f84a1e6fbe7.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 9: Detection ratio of HelloWorld with bad section attributes</p>
<p>Each section also has a Virtual Address, Virtual Size, Raw Address and Raw Size. The raw address and size are the easiest to comprehend; these are just the offsets and size of the section in the executable on disk. Each section starts at the previous section’s [address $^ +$ size], so they follow each other chronologically, they are aligned by the compiler according to the FileAlignment field of the Optional Header, so most of them contain some padding on disk. However, when the executable is loaded by the Windows PE loader, they will get loaded in Virtual Memory space. Virtual memory sections are aligned according to the Section Alignment field of the Optional Header, which usually differs from the FileAlignment field. This may cause loading of data at more distant location in memory than they are on disk, as shown by the picture below:</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/98238cc95539283da2676dae45072d16fc80e2dcd3193ce5cd144bcde5ef75d1.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 10: Memory layout of PE file - source MSDN (13)</p>
<p>Very important to note is that the code section contains references to other sections in Virtual Memory. For example, wherever in source code a static string was compared with a dynamic value, it will be fetched from the “.data” section by the code in the “.text” section to perform the comparison at execution time. This has a serious implication: sections that contain links from and to each other must remain at the offsets from each other in memory, otherwise functionality will definitely be broken at some point. This limitation cannot be mitigated easily, since these offsets were calculated at compilation time by the compiler and are not trivial to alter without interpreting the executable’s assembly code. Except the link between the “.text” and “.data” section, there is also the assumption from the “.text” section that windows API function addresses are available at a specific location in the section containing the Import Address Table. So in short, the .text, .data and section where the Import Address Table resides in (usually “.rdata” or “.idata”) must be moved as a whole when packing, in order not to break the executable. They can thus not be easily extended individually.</p>
<h1>2.2. Stub design</h1>
<p>When a packer wants to introduce new code into an existing binary, there are two significant requirements: the code must be self-contained and position independent. The former requirement exists because the stub cannot depend on the windows PE loader to resolve addresses of some windows API functions it wants to use, like normal executables do. The latter requirement is applicable because the stub must support injection in arbitrary executables, and thus may not depend on base address values of the processes they are running in.</p>
<p>These limitations coincide with the requirements of ordinary shellcode. Many packers have taken the same approach which shellcode takes to tackle these requirements: write a selfcontained stub in dedicated assembly code that dynamically locates addresses of necessary windows API functions in memory. This works, but also makes extending the stub not a trivial task, since writing position-independent assembly code requires some skills, dedication and more importantly, lots of time. Finally, it also introduces the need for one stub per architecture, as $\times 8 6$ assembly differs greatly from x64 assembly, without even mentioning ARM.</p>
<p>The new packer presented in this whitepaper currently supports both x86 and x64. ARM architecture is also theoretically supported except for a few specific bypass methods explained further below, however no test were performed on this architecture. The packer uses a modified version of the Reflective DLL Injection project (14) as a stub. The Reflective DLL was first published by Stephen Fewer in 2011 and according to its author, “Reflective DLL injection is a library injection technique in which the concept of reflective programming is employed to perform the loading of a library from memory into a host process. As such the library is responsible for loading itself by implementing a minimal Portable Executable (PE) file loader. It can then govern, with minimal interaction with the host system and process, how it will load and interact with the host. Injection works from Windows NT4 up to and including Windows 8, running on x86, x64 and ARM where applicable. “.</p>
<p>Basically, the dedicated packer presented in this paper leverages the Reflective DLL Library project to implement a stub in $\mathsf { C } { + + }$ with full windows API support, which gets loaded dynamically by the existing loader code of the project. The stub is injected in a static region of the new executable while hijacking the execution flow of the executable by altering the entry point address. As the Reflective DLL’s loader code takes care of resolving API imports and performing relocation correction, writing a packer stub in $\complement { + + }$ becomes transparent. The mechanism also allows hotpatching the stub with packer options such as the original entry point (OEP), choice of encryption algorithm and accompanying keys at packing time. The following steps depict the whole packing process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compile reflective DLL stub project to two DLLs for x86 and x64 architecture:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/f69d8014f56d8ebb8df5c5c4492f3d71d570e3a4f036388e3551a289fe6490ad.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 11: Step1 - stub generation as a DLL</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Pack the original executable by hotpaching a configuration in and injecting the appropriate stub, and then changing the entry point of the packed executable to the stub’s reflective loader address:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/7ef1d90a122846cf8f2197a9b3487dde96ce5fd8d8178f72ecf4d853dc76344b.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 12: step 2 – Stub injection and configuration hotpatching</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Upon execution, the Reflective Loader relocates itself completely to the heap, resolves its own imports and jumps to the custom function which implements the real packer’s stub functionality in the newly allocated memory:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/de5f793f49c596b18d56053bac8aa7acb637d8db7867aa436d0a7a96647d675f.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 13: step 3 - stub execution</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The stub in the heap restores original executable in memory based on hotpatched configuration, and then hands over execution:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/efb366041bf5047b8e82d2ce5aa314a2139d595719dcc4ad8f3d7c3c1492f2c6.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 14: step 4 - restore of original executable</p>
<p>The use of reflective DLL introduces an abstraction layer for the packer’s stub code. It allows developing a small and extensible framework dedicated for Antivirus detection evasion in $\mathsf { C } { + + }$ , without having to tackle issues like resolving API functions or position independency of the code.</p>
<p>The only question that remained is where exactly the stub must be injected to hijack the execution flow of the original executable without raising suspicion. This is discussed in the next subsection.</p>
<h1>2.3. Stub injection</h1>
<p>From the overview of the PE file format given in the beginning of this section, we already know that the stub must be added to the section data of the executable being packed, and be accounted for somewhere in the executable’s header. However, doing this in a generic way is not trivial, as there are some significant limitations on what can be done to an executable without triggering Antivirus detection, as discussed in section 2.1. Evading some of these limitations is a matter of implementing a good packing engine that updates all fields of the executable’s header according to the changes that have been introduced; others are influenced by the method used to inject the stub and encrypt the original data, and are more difficult to tackle in a generic approach.</p>
<p>With regard to encryption of original sections, there are two main limitations: First of all, some Data Directory table entries such as the Import Table, the Resource table and the Relocation table must point to valid structures in dedicated sections on disk (“.rdata”, “.rsrc” and “.reloc” in the case of the HelloWorld executable). This means these must remain unencrypted, or be forged to legitimate-looking but unused sections. Second of all, existing “.text”, “.data” and “.rdata” tables cannot be relocated individually but must be seen as a logical building block which can only be relocated as a whole, since the code in the “.text” section contains relative offset references to the other two aforementioned sections. This also implies that the Virtual Size of these sections cannot be extended, as this would have an influence on the addresses calculated based on the aforementioned offsets. Since the difference between the Virtual Size of a section and its Raw Size on disk usually is negligible, the stub cannot be injected in a generic fashion in or in between any of these sections by using existing code caves or extending them.</p>
<p>The packer tackled these limitations by implementing three distinct methods which encompass a combination of an encryption tactic and stub injection location. They are increasingly complex and complete in terms of data coverage of the original file. A practical comparison on both the ability to evade static Antivirus packer and packed malware detection is given in the next section, where static Antivirus detection evasion is summarized.</p>
<h1>2.3.1. Inline Packer method</h1>
<p>The inline packer method uses the most convenient approach to both encrypt data and inject the stub from a packer’s point of view, it directly encrypts sections which are not referenced by any Data Directory Table entry on-the-fly or ‘in line’, which in practice means the “.text” and “.data” section only. Additionally, it adds a new section to the existing executable wherein the stub is placed, and alters the AddressOfEntryPoint field to point at the reflective DLL loader function of the stub.</p>
<p>The stub’s actual implementation will in its turn decrypt the sections before jumping to the Original Entry Point of the executable. This or a very similar approach to stub injection is taken by most of the aforementioned compressors and protectors, they alter the section table either by adding new sections or removing existing section altogether and creating larger ones which encompass the originals. An overview of the approach taken by the inline packer method is given by the figure below:</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/9ad6b6fb79a06b09f1339068b217c1042d685f89d1f281923617f273cc465b1a.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 15: Inline Packer overview</p>
<p>When applied on the x86 Helloworld example, the following packed executable’s section table is the result (.text and .data are encrypted, .stub is new):</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/5501fc53c1310242c75d0cbff4db063d79cd42963c3cbeebcb548bd403335e1d.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 16: Inline Packer section table - CFF Explorer</p>
<p>The main upside of this approach is that it is relatively easy to implement, adding a section and changing the entry point of a PE file is a straightforward modification. One main downside is the fact that a new section is added at the very end of the file and the entry point of the executable is changed to point into this data, which can be considered as a deviation from a normal situation and thus be susceptible to packer detection. A second downside is that only the text and data sections are encrypted. If Antivirus signatures were based on other sections, detection will not be bypassed by using this approach.</p>
<h1>2.3.2. New PE Packer method</h1>
<p>In order to enhance both the stealth and the effectiveness of the Inline Packer, two related actions must be taken: first of all, the entry point must keep pointing to the first section of the executable, which is the code section with appropriate and expected ‘executable’ characteristics. This requires a more advanced method of stub injection. Second of all, more sections of the original executable must be encrypted, partly or completely, in order to ensure Antivirus signatures that are aimed at any of these sections are rendered ineffective. This is achieved by the ‘New PE Packer’ method.</p>
<p>Both requirements are tackled by this new method, which was not yet identified in currently existing packers. The approach is heavily based on proper understanding of how sections on disk (section table) are loaded into memory by the windows PE loader, which was discussed in depth in section 2.2.4. In order not to break the original executable, its section data must end up at the expected locations in memory when the unpacked executable starts execution. In order to guarantee this, the New PE Packer calculates the place in memory of the original data on disk, and saves this data encrypted at the place on disk in the new executable it will create. The stub will be placed right after this encrypted data, and this collection of data will be the new first .text section of the packed executable. The following picture summarizes the approach:</p>

<p>When applied on the $\boldsymbol { \times } 8 6$ HelloWorld example, the following packed executable section table is the result; note the very large “.text” section size, which actually contains the whole encrypted original HelloWorld binary, as well as the reflective DLL stub concatenated to it:</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/58506854c9be68a063f8c48267a40743f74059c516810b678a6aa78de92f2445.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 18: New PE Packer section table - CFF Explorer</p>
<p>This approach has a couple of consequences. First of all, in order to not look suspicious, some fake but legitimate-looking sections should be added after this .text section, which are normally present in every legitimate PE file (.data, .rsrc, .rdata, …). This data is taken from a template file that is also expected by the packing engine as an input when the New PE packing method is chosen. One exception is in place here: the new resource section of the packed file will be directly copied from the original (malicious) executable. This decision was taken after the discovery that windows API functions such as FindResource and LoadString depend on the pointer in the Data Directories of the PE header, which currently points at the new resource section, and not the old one (as this one is made invisible to Antivirus products, on purpose).</p>
<p>Second, the fact that all sections of the original file are stored encrypted in the “.text” section of the new PE file implies that the stub will have to take over some work which is normally executed by the windows PE loader. This includes relocating the original executable, if necessary, and more important, resolving its API imports dynamically. This is a method used regularly by other packers, some of which were mentioned before. The stub of the New Pe method will, in chronological order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decrypt the sections above him, which make up for the whole original executable   </li>
<li>Relocate them, if necessary   </li>
<li>Resolve its imports   </li>
<li>Jump to its Original Entry Point</li>
</ol>
<p>The main advantage of this method in comparison with the aforementioned Inline method is that the injected stub is now located in the “.text” section of the new executable and all original sections of the malware except the resource and relocation sections are stored encrypted in the new PE file, if present.</p>
<p>However, there are still two minor disadvantages: the new “.text” code consists of a lot of encrypted data and the stub, which may trigger programs that look for anomalies in these regions, such as Immunity debugger:</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/3e7017e802f71d044f1a6e2543607b35afbfad15cd497cf1fce16be7277191ad.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 19: identification of encrypted code by Immunity debugger</p>
<p>Additionally, the resource section of the original executable remains exposed. Since many droppers carry malicious files in their resource section, the overall coverage of this packing method is still not $100 %$ .</p>
<h1>2.3.3. Resource Packer Method</h1>
<p>In order to compensate the last shortcomings of the New PE packer method, a third and final approach was developed. This new method also requires a legitimate ‘template file’ as extra input for the packing engine. The original malware will be encrypted and added to this template file as a resource. Hereafter, the template file’s code section will be partly overwritten with the stub’s code, which will take care of dynamically decrypting and loading the original executable in memory.</p>
<p>Before performing import resolving and relocation of the original executable, the stub will perform all tasks the windows PE loader normally performs for a new executable. This includes copying the PE header and sections to the correct virtual memory offsets, hereby overwriting the template executable’s regions and setting the appropriate permissions based on the sections’ characteristics. The following picture summarizes the approach:</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/a61d7ead959e5d80c156ae727a4ab86be955ea33fbfb442e3849d759a0d6dfbe.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 20: Resource Packer overview</p>
<p>When using mstsc.exe as a template file, packing the Helloworld x86 binary gives the following difference in section tables (note the difference in size of the .rsrc section only):</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/45d2e3a3fbacb6e6258d6d8f6b614dd8f72047f0dba5c2ef70fe1210a43fde54.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 21: comparison of section table of template packer files - CFF Explorer</p>
<p>There are several advantages of this method. First of all, encrypted code from the original executable is saved in the resource section instead of in memory sections with guessable entropy values, such as code and data. The resource section of legitimate files, on the other hand, often contains data whose entropy can’t be predicted, and thus Antivirus products can’t make assumptions on the data in these sections. Since adding an extra resource to a PE file and hereby extending the resource section of this file is by default supported on Windows operating systems, this implies the packing method is very generic by nature.</p>
<p>Since only the stub is written in the code section of the template executable, this will not pollute the entropy values of this “.text” section and this significant detection vector for Antivirus products is completely eliminated. Additionally, the complete original executable is stored encrypted in the resulting packed file, which assures no signatures of this file can be found during static scans. Only one additional modification is made, which is the injection of the stub to the .text section of the template file. This implies that the template file will barely be tampered with, hereby reducing the chance of triggering any PE file format (packer) modification detection.</p>
<p>The only remaining disadvantage is that a lot of tasks of the windows PE loader need to be performed dynamically by the stub, which increases its complexity and size of the stub. This activity, which encompasses overwriting memory pages and modifying memory permissions dynamically, could also be used as a detection vector by Antivirus solutions. This presumption was verified empirically and the results are presented in the following section.</p>
<h1>2.3.3. Packer comparison</h1>
<p>In order to compare the three different packer methods presented above with existing packers, screenshots of the x86 HelloWorld executable packed with various popular and less popular, publicly available (demo versions of) packers are given here.</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/0797f855ba72b2888b5d277d010e782465a4c6e4137507e5c0f7e9969221ebfa.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 22: section table of unpacked HelloWorld x86 executable</p>
<p>In several of these packers, anomalies exist at both section names and section rights, as some sections are both writable and executable. Most packers have the entry point not pointing to the first section in the order list and some have a very small IAT table:</p>

<h1>3. Antivirus Evasion</h1>
<p>This chapter presents different evasion techniques to bypass Static-based detection, Emulationbased detection and Runtime-based detection mechanisms. For each measure the paper details its inner-workings. Despite the differences that could occur between Antivirus vendors, the paper presents in detail the different evasion techniques in use and documents their efficiency by showcasing the results of the different tests on the considered Antivirus products.</p>
<p>For empirical testing purposes, trial versions of Antivirus products mentioned in the introduction with an updated March 2014 signature were used as a base. Each product was run on a separate virtual machine instance without any internet connectivity, except for the initial signature-base update. Internet access was prohibited to avoid leakage of the test samples, which might trigger the creation of a new signature, and also to limit the evaluation of implemented countermeasures to the one within the Antivirus product only. Testing was performed only after enabling the most advanced protection strategies in the available GUI interface of the Antivirus.</p>
<h1>3.1. Static-based Detection Evasion</h1>
<p>Signature-based is the traditional mechanism used by Antivirus product to detect malware and malicious tools. The principle is quite simple and has seen little evolution except for the introduction of fuzzy hashing (16, 17). The mechanism creates a signature by hashing specific portions of the executable, like the code section or an entry in the resource section, and then compares it with the Antivirus database.</p>
<p>This mechanism is efficient as long the there is an existing signature in the Antivirus database. Bypassing this detection mechanism relies on changing the executable’s byte patterns in order to have a completely different signature. Other checks include verifying the PE file structure in order to detect unusual manipulation of the file. More details about these checks are mentioned in Section 2.</p>
<p>To evaluate the effectiveness of static-based detection evasion, an empirical approach by using the developed packer described in the previous section was taken. First, samples were gathered; a collection of 98 malware samples ( $\times 8 6$ only) with a high detection rate was taken from the VirusSign FreeList of March 2014 (15). Then, all samples were packed with the inline, New PE and Resource packer methods in combination with XOR encryption. Each sample was packed twice with two different stubs: one that calls ExitProcess() as soon as it starts executing, and one that really restores the original packed malware executable in memory and hands over execution to it. This distinction was made to detect code emulation, which some Antivirus vendors are explicitly stating as a detection feature in place (18,19).</p>
<p>The tests were performed in a semi-automated manner which allowed the results to be saved to a SQLite3 database. This database was queried afterwards to identify a couple of detection patterns, detailed in the sections below. Only ‘on demand’ scans were initiated, to prevent runtime detection techniques to come into play.</p>
<h1>3.1.1. Overall sample detection rate</h1>
<p>The overall detection rate merely gives an indication of the overall protection against the original, unattended samples per Antivirus product at the time of testing:</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/78dc43330df8426efa3053a7190c7473d95fa836eba9ca8caa021360de453bd9.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 40: Original sample detection</p>
<p>Kaspersky detected all 98 samples, while F-Secure and Trend Micro detected less than half of them. Of course the sample subset was not huge, but this is still an indication of how fast Antivirus companies are pushing new definitions out, as the malware sample collection was quite new.</p>
<h1>3.1.2. Packer detection</h1>
<p>It is interesting to see the detection rate of the various packer methods in combination with XOR encryption, compared with the overall detection rate of the samples per Antivirus. This allows us to grasp the real ability to bypass static signature detection techniques of each packer method, and thus also the ability of Antivirus products to detect common and less common packers. To rule out positive detection results from code emulation practices (see next subsection), only packed samples with a stub that simply quits upon execution were considered here. Each packer method’s results are provided and discussed below. Numbers relative to the detection rate of the original samples were calculated, in order to support comparing the different Antivirus products in scope.</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/b60bd81cbdffbab67cf99c3bed1e8787f78b3c93598db912840e3ac7c2570b4e.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 41: Inline Packer method detection ratio</p>
<p>As can be seen, there are big differences between Antivirus products with regard to detection of the inline packer method. F-Secure detected all 98 samples that were packed with the Inline packer, although it originally only detected 45 of these samples (see above). This explains why its relative result in this graph is far above $100 %$ , which could be interpreted as pure packer detection and not related to the samples anymore. Qihoo also detected two additional, originally undetected samples as suspicious after being packed with the inline packer.</p>
<p>The other products only detected a subset of the previously identified samples, which indicates they are detecting artifacts from the original executable that remained in the packed executable and/or the PE modifications the inline packer makes (new section where entry point refers to, encrypted “.text” and “.data” sections). We can see that Norton, Trend Micro and BitDefender do this proactively $( &gt; 7 5 % )$ , while others like Microsoft, Mcafee, Kaspersky and NOD32 do not (&lt; $1 6 %$ ).</p>
<p>Theoretically, the New PE packer method would perform better as the Inline packer method (see section 2). This is also confirmed by the detection rates for this packer method:</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/4df9a0c48107d00c81231cbd2800dca3969bfbd0855d836f71f9710e63a8520b.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 42: New PE Packer method detection ratio</p>
<p>Again, the numbers are relative to the number of original samples detected by the Antivirus products, given in the previous subsection. As can be noted, the New PE detection rate is lower as the Inline detection rate for all Antivirus products, confirming the expectation that this packer method does a better job. None of the products were able to detect more than $38 %$ of the originally detected malicious samples after being packed with this specific packing method. Besides the drop of F-Secure, positions did not significantly change, which again confirms which Antivirus vendors are performing packer detection proactively, and which are not. Note that static detection of NOD32 and Kaspersky was already completely bypassed by this packer method.</p>
<p>Finally, no graph for Resource packing detection rate is needed since not a single executable packed with the Resource packing method in combination with XOR encryption and a non-executing stub was detected. This result indicates that this method is generically applicable to bypass all existing static signature detection techniques deployed by current Antivirus products without any side effects.</p>
<h1>3.1.3. Identification of Code Emulation</h1>
<p>Some Antivirus products claim to be performing effective code emulation detection, which means executing the sample in an emulated environment to detect malicious behavior before actually executing it on the real operating system (18,19). Control over the packer’s stub allowed to explicitly detect Antivirus solutions that are performing this code emulation, by packing each sample with two stub variations: one that does nothing but calling ExitProcess() which effectively breaks the original sample, and one that decrypts the original sample and executes it in memory, as expected. The graph below highlights the percentage of samples that were undetected when the first ‘non-executing’ stub was used, but detected when the second working stub was injected, divided per packer method and Antivirus:</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/df58707ea5a1ad7a7c4ea3756e371060559ae95868064133bbd9a49ff362804e.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 43: Use of Code Emulation</p>
<p>From this graph, we can conclude a number of things with regard to implementations of code emulation in the various products in scope. First of all, five Antivirus products were found not to perform any kind of code emulation, or be already bypassed by the all the packer methods: Avast!, F-Secure, Mcafee, Norton and Trend Micro. These were left out of the graph for brevity. Others were found to only a very small number of packed samples, which may indicate some other technique then code emulation was used to achieve this, or a weak emulation engine is in use by them.</p>
<p>Only two Antivirus products were able to perform successful code emulation detection on samples packed with the highly successful Resource packer: Microsoft and Kaspersky. NOD32 and AVG were also found to perform successful code emulation detection on samples packed with the Inline and New PE packer, but not on samples packed with the Resource packer. This indicates that the code emulation engines of these products are not capable of successfully emulating executables packed with the resource packer, which highlights a significant limitation.</p>
<p>In the detection rate of both Inline and New PE packer, we could see that Microsoft, Kaspersky and NOD32 did not have the highest rates. This stresses the fact that these products are not relying heavily on static signature based detection anymore. They clearly have shifted their focus to code emulation techniques, which are a much stronger technique capable of also detecting packed executables, something which is very popular amongst malware developers to evade detection. In the next section, the code emulation engines of the two products that weren’t bypassed by the Resource packer, those of Microsoft and Kaspersky, are investigated more.</p>
<p>During empirical testing of static detection techniques, it became apparent that detection of x64 malware is not of the same quality than detection of x86 malicious. It is a fact that most malware is still written for the x86 architecture, but there have been reports of popular malware such as ZEUS having a 64-bit version, and there are predictions that other malware soon will follow. Since currently most personal computers get sold with x64 operating systems to allow more than 4 GB of RAM to be used, there is a significant possibility that malware developers will shift to these increasingly prevalent systems in the future.</p>
<p>In order to perform a comparison study between the effectiveness of malware sample detection between the x86 and x64 architecture, a toolset of which both x86 and x64 versions exist was chosen. This resulted in the following collection of hacktool samples:</p>
<p> Mimikatz (<a href="http://blog.gentilkiwi.com/mimikatz">http://blog.gentilkiwi.com/mimikatz</a>)  Windows Credentials Editor (<a href="http://www.ampliasecurity.com/research/wcefaq.html">http://www.ampliasecurity.com/research/wcefaq.html</a>)  Metasploit’s default meterpreter bind shell port 4444 (<a href="http://www.metasploit.com/">http://www.metasploit.com</a>)  Metasploit’s default Meterpreter reverse tcp shell port 4444 (<a href="http://www.metasploit.com/">http://www.metasploit.com</a>)  Metasploit’s default Meterpreter reverse https shell port 4444 (<a href="http://www.metasploit.com/">http://www.metasploit.com</a>)</p>
<p>The Metasploit samples were generated with default parameters, meaning without any shellcode encoding. First of all, the overall detection rate of the original samples for both $\tt { x 8 6 }$ and x64 is given by the following table, divided per architecture and with differences in detection between architectures highlighted:</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>Antivirus</td><td>Mimikatz</td><td>WCE</td><td></td><td>Meterpreter Bindshell</td><td>Meterpreter Reverse tcp</td><td>Meterpreter reverse https</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Avast!

<p>We can conclude that just by using an x64 reverse https Meterpreter instead of an x86 version, one can already bypass 10 out of 12 popular Antivirus solutions in scope for this research, for free. This is a very worrying result, as it clearly shows that many Antivirus companies are lagging behind on porting their detection techniques to the architecture of the (near) future. Only Avast and Norton were able to give stable detection results on this very small sample collection, regardless their architecture.</p>
<p>This trend was confirmed when analyzing the results of detection rates of the packed equivalents of these hacktool samples with the three packer methods described before. The x64 packers were found to be more successful to evade static signature based detection, as well as code emulation. Only Kaspersky and Microsoft successfully performed code emulation detection on some of the above x64 samples, but simply by using the resource packer (Microsoft) or NewPE packer (Kaspersky), samples were successfully made undetected. For the other Antivirus products, the Inline packer also sufficed. This means that with a very simple packer, any x64 file can be made undetectable for 10 out of 12 popular Antivirus products, which is remarkable.</p>
<h1>3.2. Emulation-based Detection Evasion</h1>
<p>Emulation-based detection mechanism is an advanced feature used by some Antivirus products that allows detection of new and future threats, as well as bypassing of packer protection layers. The principle is executing the malware inside a controlled environment in order to trigger the unpacking of the executable in memory, detect the end of the unpacking process by either using automated unpacker or by monitoring the execution of writable memory sections. Once the unpacking process is detected, the collected data is re-run using Static-based analysis or fed to the heuristic engine. The whole code emulation process is performed before the executable is effectively allowed to start executing on the real system, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Bypassing this Emulation-based Detection has gained popularity by malware developers who are using special checks to detect the execution of the malware inside a controlled environment, and if so, block the decryption process of the payload in memory. These checks rely on the difficulty to completely simulate a real environment.</p>
<p>The emulator executes processes in an artificial environment that emulates a real operating system. This environment implements its own virtual memory, file system, registry hives, network input/output, simulated processes and all possible subsystems in order to convince the file into thinking it is being executed on a real system.</p>
<p>Emulation, despite its efficiency as we’ll see in the rest of this paper, is however a complex component that not only must have the capacity to correctly emulate complex environment, but must have low performance impact and protections against anti-emulation checks used by malware developers. This is probably why only lightweight ‘emulation’ and no full-fledged ‘heavy’ sandboxes were identified.</p>
<p>During this research, several detection mechanisms were implemented in the packer’s stub that try to detect the emulated environment by interacting with the filesystem, network access or by performing timing checks; other checks rely on detecting binary instrumentation and discrepancies in API calls. These checks were always executed before proceeding to decrypt the original but currently encrypted executable and launching it from memory, in order to measure the effectiveness of each check.</p>
<p>The rest of this section details some of the most important Emulation-based Evasion checks and showcases their efficiency against Antivirus products that were found to do some kind of code emulation.</p>
<p>3.2.1. Code emulation bypass checks</p>
<h1>3.2.1.1. Filesystem</h1>
<p>FS1<br>This check writes a secret message to a temporary file and verifies the content by reading it afterward. This check allows the simple verification of the implementation of a persistent file system in the emulator.</p>
<p>hFile $=$ CreateFile(buff, GENERIC_READ, FILE_SHARE_READ, NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL); ReadFile(hFile, ReadBuffer, 256-1, &amp;dwBytesRead, NULL); CloseHandle(hFile); if(strstr(ReadBuffer,DataBuffer)){ return FALSE; } return TRUE; }</p>
<p>This check loads a list of real and false DLL through LoadLibrary. The check uses a deviated approach to verify the authenticity of real files on the system. If the Emulator simulates the LoadLibrary of all DLL, even the fake ones, Emulator is detected:</p>
<p>BOOL fs2()<br>{ //tries to load existing and fake obscure DLL, if fake have a real<br>address, it is emulated, if obscure but existing are not loaded, it is<br>emulated char *realDLL[] $=$ {"Kernel32.DLL", "networkexplorer.DLL",<br>"NlsData000c.DLL"}; char *falseDLL[] $=$ {"NetProjW.DLL", "Ghofr.DLL"}; HMODULE hInstLib; for(int $\mathrm { i } = 0$ ; $\mathrm { i } &lt;$ (sizeof(realDLL)/sizeof(*realDLL)); i++) { //printf("%s\n", realDLL[i]); hInstLib $=$ LoadLibraryA( realDLL[i] ); if(hInstLib $= =$ NULL) return TRUE; FreeLibrary(hInstLib); } for(int $\dot { \beth } = { \mathbf { \Phi } }$ ; i&lt;(sizeof(falseDLL)/sizeof(*falseDLL)); i++) { //printf("%s\n", falseDLL[i]); hInstLib $=$ LoadLibraryA( falseDLL[i] ); if(hInstLib ! $! =$ NULL) return TRUE; }<br>}</p>
<h1>3.2.1.2. Timing</h1>
<p>Time1</p>
<p>Delays unpacking of the executable using a call to the Sleep function. This technique has widely been used by malware. Antivirus products have countered this protection by emulating the execution of Sleep and reducing the time interval.</p>
<h1>Source 4: Delay the unpacking</h1>
<p>Time2</p>
<p>This technique is a good example of how malware developers have adapted to the evolution of Antivirus protection mechanism. The following check uses a call to the GetTickCount to detect any Sleep emulation. Antivirus has in parallel implemented countermeasures that emulate both the Sleep and GetTickCount functions as detected during our tests by some Antivirus.</p>
<p>BOOL time2()<br>{ DWORD tc1, tc2; tc1 $=$ GetTickCount(); Sleep(1000); $\scriptstyle \pm \subset 2 \ =$ GetTickCount(); tc2 $=$ tc2-tc1; //DebugBreak(); if(tc2 $\scriptstyle &gt; = \quad 1$ ) { return FALSE; } return TRUE;<br>}</p>
<h1>Source 5: Detection of Sleep emulation using GetTickCount</h1>
<h1>Time3</h1>
<p>This check has been created to exploit the emulation of the Sleep function done in Antivirus Emulator. The principle relies on the reduction of the Sleep time to detect discrepancies. The check creates two threads executed simultaneously, the first thread performs a large Sleep, 100 milliseconds for instance plus an arbitrary delay due to thread creation, and then checks the value of a counter with an initial value of 0, the second thread executes a multitude of Sleep function of a reduced delay, for instance 10 Sleep of 10 milliseconds, after each Sleep, the counter value is incremented, until it reaches the final value, 10 in our case for example.</p>
<p>In normal execution without any Sleep emulation, when the first thread performs the check, the counter has reached the expected value, in an emulated environment, the Sleep is rapidly executed and the check is performed before the counter has reached its final value.</p>

<p>This technique was first documented by Jérôme Nokin in MISC 61. The check connects to port 445 (SMB), used by all professional Microsoft Windows versions. Most Sandboxes as a measure of precaution don’t allow any network connectivity, allowing the packer to detect emulation without the need of remote server component.</p>

<h1>Source 7: SMB port connection</h1>
<p>Web1</p>
<p>This check uses internet connectivity to verify the content of a specified URL. The URL and the content is determined during the generation of the new executable by using common URLs and avoid the introduction of new detection vector by specifying a specific C&amp;C URL. This measure requires internet connectivity usually blocked by emulators. Allowing internet connectivity will allow Malware developers to leak information through the emulator, which could be used to fingerprint the used engine and eventually identify new evasion vectors.</p>
<h1>3.2.1.4. Instrumentation</h1>
<p>Instrumentation is a method of analyzing the behavior of a binary application at runtime through the injection of instrumentation code. This instrumentation code executes as part of the normal instruction stream after being injected. Famous instrumentation frameworks include PIN by Intel, Valgrind and DynamicRIO.</p>
<p>If Antivirus products use Instrumentation to analyze binaries, only Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI) is possible as Antiviruses only have access to the final binary and not the source code.</p>
<p>To detect the use of instrumentation by Antivirus, several check have been implemented, mostly based on the work “Detecting Dynamic Binary Instrumentation Frameworks” by Francisco Falcón and Nahuel Riva from CORE Impact. This an overview of the most notable and generic checks:</p>
<p>Instrumentation1</p>
<p>This function checks the parameters of the command line to search for certain strings. This check is initially very specific to PIN.</p>

<h1>3.2.2. Test results</h1>
<p>Tests showed that emulation-based analysis has been implemented quite effectively by two Antivirus vendors, Microsoft and Kaspersky. These two products have been able to significantly detect samples that were using different packing schemes with different encryption ciphers, even with the Resource packer method (see 3.1).</p>
<p>For Microsoft, the emulator could be completely bypassed using technique Time3 (multithreaded sleep), Network445 (connection to SMB), FS2 (fake and real LoadLibrary) and Instrumentation1.</p>
<p>Kaspersky has shown on the other hand great robustness against the different techniques as only FS2 (fake and real LoadLibrary) was able to completely bypass the emulator engine.</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/4e0e1239cca07be1ca26e3efeeca4f41c625ab37dbfc1233e180bc8ff0531b2c.jpg" alt=""><br>Figure 44: Anti-emulation efficiency per check</p>
<h1>3.3. Runtime-based Detection Evasion</h1>
<p>Runtime analysis is another advanced feature implemented by some Antivirus product to analyze executables that have bypassed all the Pre-execution detection stages (Static and</p>
<p>Emulation). The decision to perform runtime analysis depends greatly on the setting of the Antivirus and the behavior of the executable. Certain actions, like changing registry keys to achieve persistence, performing DLL injection or process hollowing (20) are examples of actions that might trigger Antivirus detection, as these functionalities are usually used by malware. However, samples that do not exhibit these specific detection vectors are not detected by this technique, and by utilizing the research results of the previous two Antivirus evasion subsection, can be rendered completely undetected in a trivial matter by utilizing the Resource Packer.</p>
<p>These actions that are detected at runtime have a common signature that could be defined by a succession of API calls with particular parameters, if we take the example of process hollowing for instance:</p>
<p>//source <a href="http://www.autosectools.com/process-hollowing.pdf">http://www.autosectools.com/process-hollowing.pdf</a><br>HMODULE hNTDLL $=$ GetModuleHandleA("ntdll");<br>FARPROC fpNtUnmapViewOfSection $=$ GetProcAddress(hNTDLL,<br>"NtUnmapViewOfSection"); _NtUnmapViewOfSection NtUnmapViewOfSection $=$ (_NtUnmapViewOfSection)fpNtUnmapViewOfSection; DWORD dwResult $=$ NtUnmapViewOfSection ( pProcessInfo-&gt;hProcess, pPEB-&gt;ImageBaseAddress ); if (dwResult) { printf("Error unmapping section\r\n"); return; } printf("Allocating memory\r\n"); PVOID pRemoteImage $=$ VirtualAllocEx ( pProcessInfo-&gt;hProcess, pPEB-&gt;ImageBaseAddress, pSourceHeaders-&gt;OptionalHeader.SizeOfImage, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE );<br>if (!pRemoteImage) { printf("VirtualAllocEx call failed\r\n"); return; } DWORD dwDelta $=$ (DWORD)pPEB-&gt;ImageBaseAddress pSourceHeaders-&gt;OptionalHeader.ImageBase; printf ( "Source image base: 0x%p\r\n" "Destination image base: 0x%p\r\n",</p>
<p>pSourceHeaders-&gt;OptionalHeader.ImageBase, pPEB-&gt;ImageBaseAddress ); printf("Relocation delta: 0x%p\r\n", dwDelta); pSourceHeaders-&gt;OptionalHeader.ImageBase $=$ (DWORD)pPEB-&gt;ImageBaseAddress; printf("Writing headers\r\n"); if (!WriteProcessMemory ( pProcessInfo-&gt;hProcess, pPEB-&gt;ImageBaseAddress, pBuffer, pSourceHeaders-&gt;OptionalHeader.SizeOfHeaders, 0 ))</p>
<p>It is possible to identify a pattern which is determining the address of NtUnmapViewOfSection, calling NtUnmapViewOfSection, VirtualAllocEx and WriteProcessMemory with the same initial parameters for instance.</p>
<p>Process hollowing includes more actions with use of particular API to perform the following actions:</p>
<p>● Opening source image and unmapping destination section ● Allocating memory and writing of different section Image rebasing if needed Getting and setting of thread context and resume thread execution</p>
<p>Another example of actions triggering Antivirus runtime detection is Meterpreter migrate to specific processes, like explorer.exe. AVG for instance detects this action as suspicious behavior and kills the Meterpreter session:</p>
<p><img src="https://blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/images/6076f9d6b338fd7ea36abb0ccaa67b052dc34418e92397ac765177affa4d2572.jpg" alt=""><br>Source 10: Process Hollowing by John Leitch<br>Figure 45: Meterpreter migrate to explorer.exe</p>

<p>This section covers some techniques to evade Runtime analysis by translating API call and by injecting junk API calls that won’t alter the final malicious activity, but will alter their succession. These techniques relies on Inline Hooking to effectively alter the final application, which is detailed in the below section. Other techniques still in development are part of future work.</p>
<h1>3.3.1. Inline hooking</h1>
<p>Inline hooking is a dynamic hooking technique that has widely been used by both malware developers and malware analysts to monitor application inner working or to alter other applications and potentially inject malicious actions. It is a dynamic hooking technique performed on an already running application, which modifies memory portions in order to redirect control flow to a new function. To explain the different steps needed to perform, let’s take the following x64 example calling the CreateFileW function.</p>
<p>This is the disassembly of the function before hooking. In order to correctly modify the memory portion without breaking the application, the hooking engine must have disassembling capacities in order to safely inject the redirection routine:</p>

<p>After hooking, a MOV, JMP routine is injected and then correctly padded with NOP. 0x17fde1032 is the address of the hooking function that has access to all function parameters and can perform the interception actions. After hooking:</p>

<p>The old instructions are saved in a trampoline function which will be used if the application needs to resume the execution of the old function. Before saving the trampoline code, instructions must be corrected in case for instance it is using relative jump:</p>

<p>Inline hooking operates in user land and has the advantage of being performed before the SSDT hooking performed on kernel land, usually used by Antiviruses. Inline hooking is particularly useful to perform actions, like API translation detailed in the section below.</p>

<h1>3.3.2. API translation</h1>
<p>API translation is a technique that transforms certain API calls with specific parameters, flagged as suspicious or dangerous, into a different form that is more difficult to analyze. A common example is setting autorun registry key to achieve system persistence, by adding for instance an entry to "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run".</p>
<p>Some Antivirus solutions and sandboxes will use these indicators to determine the risk profile of the application.</p>
<p>The API call in the example, if transformed into a call to system(“reg.exe add ‘\.\HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run’ …”) will not trigger any flags as the system API call don’t have a heuristic signature for this executable, and will maybe also be handled by a different processor.</p>
<p>To perform this kind of transformation, the packer uses Inline hooking to intercept the call for registry manipulation API, replace the function in charge of saving a value into a system call without sending the execution to the original function, bypassing this way all hooking methods that operates after the Inline hook.</p>
<p>In the following code excerpt from the packer, we can see the function in charge setting hooks and initializing certain variables:</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>void hookRegPersist(){</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>HINSTANCE hAdvapi32; rrs = (regSave *) malloc(sizeof(regSave));</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>hAdvapi32 = LoadLibraryA("Advapi32.dll");</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Real_RegOpenKeyExW = (REFOPENKEYEXW)VirtualAllocEx(GetCurrentProcess(),</td><td>NULL,</td></tr><tr><td>TRAMPSIZE,</td><td>sizeof(BYTE) *</td></tr><tr><td>MEM_RESERVE,</td><td>MEM COMMIT I</td></tr><tr><td>PAGE EXECUTE READWRITE);</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Real_RegSetValueExW = (REGSETVALUEEXW)VirtualAllocEx(GetCurrentProcess(),</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NULL, sizeof(BYTE) *</td></tr><tr><td>TRAMPSIZE,</td><td>MEM COMMIT I</td></tr><tr><td>MEM_RESERVE,</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>PAGE EXECUTE READWRITE);</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>if(HookAttach((ULONG_PTR)GetProcAddress(hAdvapi32, "RegOpenKeyExW"),</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>printf("[*] RegOpenKeyExW Hooked\n");</td><td>(ULONG_PTR)Real_RegOpenKeyExW, (ULONG_PTR)My_RegOpenKeyExW) == TRUE) {</td></tr><tr><td>}</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(ULONG_PTR)Real_RegSetValueExW, (ULONG_PTR)My_RegSetValueExW) == TRUE) {</td><td>if(HookAttach((ULONG_PTR)GetProcAddress(hAdvapi32, "RegSetValueExW"),</td></tr><tr><td>printf("[*] RegSetValueExW Hooked\n");</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>}</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>}</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>The first call to RegOpenKey allows keeping track of hKey handle and the subkey value. This action is necessary as there is no function that allows accessing this information from hKey handle only:</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>HANDLE WINAPI My_RegOpenKeyExW(HKEY hKey,</td></tr><tr><td>LPCTSTR lpSubKey,</td></tr><tr><td>DWORD ulOptions,</td></tr><tr><td>REGSAM samDesired,</td></tr><tr><td>PHKEY phkResult)</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>rrs-&gt;hRegKey = hKey;</td></tr><tr><td>rrs-&gt;hRegKeyRes = phkResult;</td></tr><tr><td>rrs-&gt;lpKeyName = lpSubKey;</td></tr><tr><td>return Real_RegOpenKeyExW(hKey, lpSubKey, ulOptions, samDesired,</td></tr><tr><td>phkResult);</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Once a call to the function in charge of setting the new key is triggered, the different parameters are used to create the final command to be executed:</p>
<p>HANDLE WINAPI My_RegSetValueExW(HKEY hKey, LPCTSTR lpValueName, DWORD Reserved, DWORD dwType, const BYTE *lpData, DWORD cbData)<br>{ char lcCommand[256]; char clClass[16]; char clType[16]; if(*(rrs-&gt;hRegKeyRes) $= =$ hKey){ if(rrs-&gt;hRegKey $= =$ HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT) sprintf_s(clClass, "%s", "HKCR"); else if(rrs-&gt;hRegKey $= =$ HKEY_CURRENT_USER) sprintf_s(clClass, "%s", "HKCU"); else if(rrs-&gt;hRegKey $= =$ HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE) sprintf_s(clClass, "%s", "HKCM"); else{ return Real_RegSetValueExW(hKey, lpValueName, Reserved, dwType,<br>lpData, cbData); } if(dwType $= =$ REG_NONE) { sprintf_s(clType, "%s", "REG_NONE"); } else if(dwType $= =$ REG_SZ) { sprintf_s(clType, "%s", "REG_SZ"); } else if(dwType $= =$ REG_EXPAND_SZ) { sprintf_s(clType, "%s", "REG_EXPAND_SZ"); } ..[SNIP].. sprintf_s(lcCommand, "reg add %s\%ws /v "%ws" /t %s /d "%ws" /f",<br>clClass, rrs-&gt;lpKeyName, lpValueName, clType, lpData); system(lcCommand); free(rrs); return ERROR_SUCCESS; } else { free(rrs); return Real_RegSetValueExW(hKey, lpValueName, Reserved, dwType,<br>lpData, cbData); }<br>}</p>
<h1>3.3.3. API junk injection</h1>
<p>Antivirus and some Sandbox product use information collected from API calls succession with certain parameters to identify actions known to be used by malware developers or malicious applications, like DLL injection, Process Hollowing or techniques used to dump passwords and hashes by intrusively modifying system processors.</p>
<p>To make identification of these actions more difficult, API junk injection, as the name already states, inject junk API calls that have no impact on the control flow of the application, but alters the expected succession of the APIs.</p>
<p>To perform this modification, a list of API is monitored through Inline hooking, in order to trigger a call to several useless APIs. The list of important functions to monitor was based on the Cuckoo Sandbox monitoring list. The disadvantage however of this technique is the performance impact due the multiplication of every API call by the number of junk calls injected.</p>
<h1>4. Conclusion</h1>
<p>During this research, the various detection techniques of current popular Antivirus solutions were examined (Static-based, Emulation-based and Runtime-based); New bypass techniques were developed and empirically verified with regard to their effectiveness.</p>
<p>Two new methods of packing executables were developed, one of which turned out to be very efficient in evading all current Antivirus products without the use of emulation, which is the ‘Resource packer’. A myriad of anti-emulation checks were implemented and tested demonstrating the capacity to bypass all the existing engines, while also demonstrating the robustness and efficiency of this protection measure in detecting new and evolving threats.</p>
<p>Venues on bypassing Runtime-based detection were explored, but still require further testing to evaluate their effectiveness, which is also probably more adapted for sandbox-based analysis than for Antivirus solutions, as these solutions can spend more resources on detection techniques.</p>
<p>The introduction of cloud based scanning using dedicated analysis resource, leveraging advanced approach to analyzing malware, like machine learning and the spring of new products using a sandbox-based approach, represent a promising advancement to a better detection of unknown new threats and known evolving ones.</p>
<p>It is however clear that for the moment, a bullet proof Antivirus solution is still yet to come despite the significant advances that some of these solutions have made. The very high number of new threats appearing each day and the ease with which a PE file can be modified makes a Static-based approach un-adapted and outdated for current threats. Emulation-based detection techniques are a very powerful approach, but have to deal with performance and complexity issues in order to create a completely undetectable environment, and this without going philosophical and mentioning the Schrödinger cat and how an action of testing or measure will undoubtedly change it, making it always detectable.</p>
<p>Some Antiviruses did however came a long way and are undoubtedly an important layer of protection in the security landscape of any environment, they are however not sufficient nor will they ever be.</p>
