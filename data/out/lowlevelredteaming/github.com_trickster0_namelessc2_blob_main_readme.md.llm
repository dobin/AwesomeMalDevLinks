Title:
Nameless C2 – A C2 with all its components written in Rust

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- NamelessC2 is a small, unfinished command-and-control framework where the server, terminal, and Windows implant are implemented in Rust.  
- The author published it as a learning project and a base for others to extend, highlighting a relatively small Windows implant size (~256 KB) and a working sleep obfuscation technique based on EkkoEx.  
- The implant is built as a DLL exporting `DiagnosisCheck`, and the repo includes a modified sRDI workflow to convert the DLL into shellcode.  
- Operationally, it uses a log-file driven output model (similar to PoshC2) where operators tail `NamelessLog.txt` to monitor activity.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers/pentesters and malware researchers who want a Rust-based C2/implant starting point with basic OPSEC-related features (sleep obfuscation) and multiple payload formats (DLL/shellcode).  

Technical Focus:
- Rust-based C2 architecture (server/terminal/implant)
- Windows implant as DLL with exported entrypoint (`DiagnosisCheck`)
- Sleep obfuscation (EkkoEx-style)
- sRDI-based DLL-to-shellcode conversion
- Indirect syscalls (credited implementation)
- Build/targeting considerations (Windows GNU target, Debian server deps)

Use Cases:
- Build and extend a minimal Rust Windows implant and C2 stack
- Generate shellcode from a Rust DLL implant for in-memory execution chains
- Experiment with sleep obfuscation approaches to reduce behavioral detection
- Prototype C2 operator workflows using log-based output collection
- Research/compare Rust tradecraft patterns (syscalls, loaders, payload formats)
