Title:
Learning Sliver C2 (01) – Installation on Kali Linux

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post walks through installing BishopFox’s Sliver C2 framework on a fresh Kali Linux server as the first entry in a beginner-focused series.  
- It covers both installing from official release binaries and building Sliver from source for easier customization.  
- The author explains Sliver’s client-server (multi-operator) architecture, including running the server as a systemd service and verifying it is listening on TCP/31337.  
- It details operator onboarding via mutual TLS: generating operator configs on the server, placing them in `~/.sliver-client/configs`, and connecting with the `sliver` client.  
- The post also notes Sliver’s use of a bundled Go toolchain and garble for building/obfuscating Go implants, and recommends installing MinGW-w64 for cross-compilation.  
- Useful for red teamers/pentesters setting up an open-source C2 lab environment and wanting a reproducible, non-“curl|bash” installation path.

Technical Focus:
- Sliver client-server architecture and multi-operator setup  
- systemd service deployment on Linux  
- mTLS operator authentication (certs, keys, token)  
- Cross-compilation toolchains (MinGW-w64) for Windows payloads  
- Building Go projects from source (make, assets download)  
- Sliver asset unpacking and embedded Go toolchain/garble

Use Cases:
- Stand up a Sliver C2 server on Kali for a home lab or test range
- Create and distribute operator configs for collaborative operations
- Run Sliver persistently via systemd and validate network exposure/ports
- Build customized Sliver binaries from source for experimentation
- Prepare a Linux build environment for generating Windows implants (via MinGW-w64)
