Title:
AntimalwareBlight

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- AntimalwareBlight is a PowerShell module that demonstrates executing PowerShell code at the “antimalware-light” protection level on Windows.  
- It targets weaknesses in the Early Launch Anti-Malware (ELAM) ecosystem, showing that anti-tampering guarantees depend on the least restrictive third-party ELAM driver.  
- The repo accompanies the REcon 2022 / Black Hat USA 2022 research (“Living Off the Walled Garden”) and is intended as a proof-of-concept rather than a fully weaponized bypass.  
- The module must be run elevated and relies on the user finding an overly permissive ELAM driver that will allow Microsoft-signed code (a specific TBS hash is referenced).  
- It’s useful for red teamers and security researchers to understand and validate ELAM/anti-tamper trust assumptions, and for defenders/vendors to assess supply-chain and driver policy risk.

Technical Focus:
- Windows ELAM (Early Launch Anti-Malware) architecture and trust model
- Antimalware-light / anti-tamper protection level concepts
- Driver policy weaknesses and “weakest vendor” dependency
- PowerShell module-based execution and controlled PoC design
- TBS (Trusted Boot/Code integrity-related) hash allowlisting implications

Use Cases:
- Evaluate whether endpoint anti-tamper can be undermined via permissive ELAM drivers
- Reproduce and study the “antimalware-light” execution context for research/testing
- Assess third-party ELAM driver policy quality in an enterprise environment
- Inform defensive hardening and vendor risk management around boot-start drivers
