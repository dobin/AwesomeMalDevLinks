Title:
All about cli4bofs tool

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- The post introduces **cli4bofs**, a command-line interface for documenting and executing Beacon Object Files (BOFs) directly from the filesystem without running Cobalt Strike, Sliver, or Metasploit.  
- It proposes a **universal YAML metadata schema** (name, description, OS, entrypoint/API exports, arguments, errors, examples, sources) to standardize BOF “manuals” similar to Cobalt Strike `.cna` scripts or Sliver extension manifests.  
- Metadata is embedded into BOF source files using `///`-prefixed lines and aggregated at build time into a single `BOF-collection.yaml` consumed by cli4bofs.  
- The tool provides `list`, `info <BOF>` (pretty help/usage), and `exec <BOF>` (run BOFs locally) and uses a typed-argument format compatible with Meterpreter `execute_bof` and Sliver COFF loader conventions.  
- Under the hood it relies on **Z-Labs bof-launcher** and supports Windows/Linux across multiple architectures with Zig-based cross-compilation.  
- It also includes a workflow to **fetch and build third-party BOFs** from `sources:` URLs and then use the resulting artifacts with Meterpreter’s `execute_bof`.  
- Useful for red teamers/BOF developers who need repeatable testing, consistent documentation, and easier BOF reuse across frameworks.

Technical Focus:
- BOF metadata standardization via YAML (arguments, errors, examples, sources)
- Local BOF execution (COFF/ELF object loading) via bof-launcher
- Typed BOF argument encoding (int/short/str/wstr/file buffer)
- Zig build system and cross-compilation for multi-arch payload tooling
- Integrating third-party BOF collections (fetch/build pipeline)
- Interop with Cobalt Strike/Sliver/Meterpreter BOF ecosystems

Use Cases:
- Quickly view BOF usage/help outside of Cobalt Strike `.cna` scripts
- Execute and debug BOFs locally in a lab without a C2 framework
- Maintain a curated BOF catalog with consistent argument/error documentation
- Fetch/build BOFs from public repos and produce ready-to-run COFF/ELF artifacts
- Prepare BOFs for Meterpreter `execute_bof` usage and automation
