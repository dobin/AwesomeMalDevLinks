Title:
Exploration C2 Framework (C2TeamServer)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository provides the TeamServer and operator client for “Exploration,” a modular command-and-control (C2) framework aimed at red team operations.  
- The backend TeamServer is a standalone C++ application that manages listeners and active implant sessions, while the Python client connects to it over gRPC for operator workflows.  
- Implants (“beacons”) from companion projects (C2Implant for Windows and C2LinuxImplant for Linux) call back to the TeamServer to establish interactive sessions for tasking and output retrieval.  
- It supports multiple C2 transport channels including TCP, SMB, HTTP, and HTTPS, with TLS certificates used for gRPC/HTTP(S) communications.  
- The project includes Docker-based deployment guidance and a build pipeline using CMake and Conan, plus a linked blog series detailing design/implementation decisions.  
- Useful primarily for red teamers and C2 developers who want a reference implementation of a modern, extensible C2 stack with a separable operator UI and transport/listener architecture.

Technical Focus:
- C2 architecture (TeamServer/client separation)  
- gRPC-based operator control plane + authentication (token-based)  
- Multi-transport listener design (TCP/SMB/HTTP/HTTPS)  
- Beacon/session management and tasking model  
- TLS certificate handling for secure channels  
- Build/dependency tooling (CMake, Conan) and Docker deployment

Use Cases:
- Stand up a lab C2 for red team tradecraft development and testing
- Develop/extend custom listeners, modules, or operator workflows
- Evaluate gRPC-based C2 control-plane design and auth patterns
- Run multi-protocol C2 infrastructure (HTTP(S), SMB, raw TCP) for exercises
- Use as a learning reference alongside the “Building a Modern C2” blog series
