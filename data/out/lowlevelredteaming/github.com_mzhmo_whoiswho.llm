Title:
WhoIsWho — Alternatives to the Windows `whoami` command

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository is a collection of proof-of-concept “whoami alternatives” for Windows, implemented in C++.  
- It addresses situations where calling `whoami.exe` is undesirable (e.g., restricted environments, application allowlisting, or wanting different telemetry/detection surfaces) by retrieving the current user identity through multiple APIs and subsystems.  
- Each folder demonstrates a different technique to obtain username/domain/SID context, ranging from simple Win32 calls (e.g., `GetUserNameW`, environment variables) to LSA/SID resolution and COM/WMI-based approaches.  
- The project is useful for red teamers and malware developers exploring low-friction host identity discovery and for blue teamers mapping which API paths generate which logs/EDR signals.  
- It’s interesting as a compact reference of diverse identity-discovery primitives across Win32, LSA, WMI, Terminal Services, and directory-related interfaces.

Technical Focus:
- Win32 identity APIs (`GetUserNameW`, `GetUserProfileDirectory`, `GetEnvironmentVariableW`)
- SID-to-name resolution (`LookupAccountSidW`, `LsaLookupSids`)
- Process environment/PEB structures (`RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS`)
- WMI/COM enumeration (`IEnumWbemClassObject`)
- Terminal Services session queries (`WTSQuerySessionInformation`)
- AD/Directory/management interfaces (e.g., `ADSystemInfo`, `ADsComputer`, `IWSMan`)

Use Cases:
- Replace `whoami.exe` in implants/tools to reduce dependency on external binaries
- Compare detection/telemetry differences between identity-discovery methods
- Host/user context checks before privilege escalation or lateral movement steps
- Build minimal “situational awareness” modules for Windows payloads
- Defensive testing: create detections for suspicious identity enumeration via uncommon APIs
