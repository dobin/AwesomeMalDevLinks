Title:
SCCMDecryptor BOF

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository provides a Cobalt Strike Beacon Object File (BOF) that decrypts Microsoft SCCM/MECM encrypted credential blobs extracted from the SCCM site database.  
- It reimplements Adam Chester (@_xpn_)’s original C# SCCM decryptor as an in-memory BOF for use during operations where dropping binaries is undesirable.  
- The BOF must be executed on an SCCM server that has the “Microsoft Systems Management Server” Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP), leveraging the local SCCM crypto material to recover plaintext credentials.  
- Operators supply a hex-encoded encrypted blob (from the DB) and the BOF returns the decrypted secret.  
- It is primarily useful for red teams and pentesters targeting SCCM environments, especially in post-compromise credential access and lateral movement workflows.  
- It maps to known SCCM credential exposure/misconfiguration tradecraft (referenced as Misconfiguration Manager Cred-5).

Technical Focus:
- SCCM/MECM credential blob decryption
- Microsoft Systems Management Server CSP usage
- Cobalt Strike BOF (in-memory execution)
- Site database credential extraction workflow (offline-to-online decryption)
- Cross-compilation with MinGW-w64 (x86/x64)

Use Cases:
- Decrypt credentials harvested from SCCM site DB tables/records during post-exploitation
- Convert SCCM “encrypted password blob” artifacts into usable plaintext creds for lateral movement
- Run credential decryption capability inside Beacon without writing a standalone executable to disk
- Validate SCCM credential exposure paths during internal assessments
