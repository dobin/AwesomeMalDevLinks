Title:
Bypassing BitLocker Encryption: Bitpixie PoC and WinPE Edition

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post describes a software-only attack chain (“Bitpixie”) to bypass BitLocker full-disk encryption on Windows laptops that rely on TPM-only protection (no pre-boot PIN/key).  
- It builds a public PoC based on prior research/talks, showing how to boot attacker-controlled but Secure Boot–accepted components and then extract the BitLocker Volume Master Key (VMK) from physical memory to unlock the disk.  
- The Linux edition uses PXE to downgrade to a vulnerable Windows Boot Manager, then boots signed shim/GRUB/kernel and abuses Linux kernel lockdown weaknesses to scan RAM for the VMK and mount the volume via dislocker.  
- The WinPE edition adapts the chain for devices that disable Microsoft 3rd-party UEFI certs (e.g., secured-core PCs) by using only Microsoft-signed Windows boot components, then scanning memory with a modified WinPmem and deriving the human-readable recovery password from BitLocker metadata.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teams and physical penetration testers demonstrating impact of stolen-device scenarios under Secure Boot, and for defenders validating exposure and prioritizing mitigations.  
- The key remediation highlighted is enforcing pre-boot authentication (BitLocker PIN and/or startup key), which breaks both software and many hardware-assisted TPM attacks.

Technical Focus:
- BitLocker TPM-only threat model (no pre-boot authentication)
- Secure Boot trust chains (Microsoft 1st-party vs 3rd-party UEFI certificates)
- PXE boot, BCD manipulation, and boot manager downgrade
- Physical memory acquisition and VMK extraction (pattern matching)
- WinPE boot flow (boot.wim/boot.sdi, winload.efi, ntoskrnl.exe) and signed driver usage
- BitLocker metadata parsing and recovery password derivation

Use Cases:
- Validate whether endpoints are vulnerable to Bitpixie-style BitLocker bypass
- Demonstrate rapid offline compromise of stolen laptops in red team engagements
- Assess Secure Boot configuration impact (3rd-party UEFI cert disabled vs enabled)
- Develop/operate PXE-based boot chains for controlled forensic or adversarial testing
- Inform hardening guidance: enforce BitLocker PIN/startup key and review boot component trust
