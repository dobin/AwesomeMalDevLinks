Title:
EVILRDP – More control over RDP

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
EVILRDP is an “evil twin” RDP client built on SkelSec’s `aardwolf` library that combines a normal RDP GUI session with an interactive command shell for automation and post-auth control. It aims to give operators more granular control over an RDP session than standard clients, including scripted mouse/keyboard actions, clipboard automation, screenshots, and file transfer capabilities. A key feature is establishing a custom `PSCMD` virtual channel/agent to execute PowerShell and shell commands on the target without uploading binaries, and to enable additional functions like remote file get and a SOCKS proxy. It also supports multiple authentication modes via URL schemes, including CredSSP with NTLM/Kerberos and pass-the-hash for NTLM. This is primarily useful for red teams and pentesters who already have RDP access and want automation, covert-ish command execution, and pivoting over an allowed RDP path. It’s interesting because it turns RDP into a controllable C2-like transport (e.g., SOCKS-over-RDP) and operationalizes RDP virtual channels for post-auth actions.

Technical Focus:
- RDP client implementation via `aardwolf` / `aardwolfgui`
- RDP virtual channels (PSCMD channel/agent concept)
- CredSSP (“HYBRID”) authentication with NTLM/Kerberos and pass-the-hash
- Automated GUI interaction (mouse/keyboard) and clipboard control
- SOCKS4a/SOCKS5 proxying tunneled over RDP
- File transfer and remote command execution over an RDP session

Use Cases:
- Automate actions inside an interactive RDP desktop (typing, clicks, launching Run, screenshots)
- Execute PowerShell/shell commands on a host where only RDP is available/allowed
- Pivot into an internal network by spawning a SOCKS proxy over an RDP connection
- Exfiltrate or stage data via clipboard/file up/download even when standard transfers are restricted
- Use pass-the-hash with RDP (NTLM) for post-compromise lateral movement workflows
