Title:
no-defender

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- no-defender is a Windows tool intended to disable Microsoft Defender and optionally the Windows Firewall by abusing the Windows Security Center (WSC) mechanism used by third‑party AV products.  
- It works by registering a fake/alternate antivirus via an undocumented WSC API so Windows believes another AV is present and turns off Defender accordingly.  
- The repository notes the WSC API is not publicly documented and typically requires an NDA with Microsoft, implying reverse engineering or private interface usage.  
- Persistence across reboot is achieved by adding the tool to autorun, requiring the binaries to remain on disk.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teams, pentesters, and malware developers evaluating defensive gaps and bypass paths; it’s also relevant to blue teams for understanding WSC-based tampering.  
- The repo was archived and its contents/releases were wiped following a DMCA complaint, leaving mainly the README and usage details.

Technical Focus:
- Windows Security Center (WSC) API abuse (undocumented interfaces)
- Defender disablement via third-party AV registration semantics
- Windows Firewall disablement toggling
- Persistence via autorun (startup registration)
- Security product tampering / defense evasion on Windows

Use Cases:
- Disabling Defender during offensive security testing to run tooling without AV interference
- Simulating “installed third-party AV” conditions to study Defender/WSC behavior
- Testing blue-team detections for WSC registration changes and AV/firewall state transitions
- Evaluating persistence and on-disk artifact risks of WSC-based bypasses
