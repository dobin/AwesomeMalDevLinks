Title:
Awesome BOF (chryzsh/awesome-bof)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository is a curated catalog of Beacon Object Files (BOFs) with a fast, searchable web index.  
- It solves the problem of discovering and quickly locating relevant BOFs across many GitHub projects by maintaining a centralized markdown catalog (BOF-CATALOG.md) and a generated JSON search index (bof-index.json).  
- The repo includes automation/scripts to discover, parse, and index BOF source repositories, plus a GitHub Pages site for interactive search.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers and penetration testers building Cobalt Strike/BOF-based post-exploitation workflows, and for BOF developers looking for examples and prior art.  
- It’s interesting because it operationalizes BOF discovery at scale (including periodic/automated updates) and provides reproducible tooling to keep the index current.

Technical Focus:
- Beacon Object Files (Cobalt Strike BOF ecosystem)
- Automated BOF discovery and repository parsing/indexing
- Search index generation (JSON) + static web search (GitHub Pages)
- Contribution workflow automation (row generation, catalog updates)
- Python-based tooling and CI-style update workflows

Use Cases:
- Quickly find BOFs for specific post-exploitation tasks (credential access, AD abuse, token theft, etc.)
- Build/extend a BOF toolkit by referencing existing implementations and APIs used
- Maintain an internal BOF catalog by reusing the indexer and site-generation scripts
- Track new BOF releases via periodic discovery and catalog updates
