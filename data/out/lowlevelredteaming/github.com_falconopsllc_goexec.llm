Title:
GoExec – Remote Execution Multitool

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- GoExec is a Go-based Windows remote execution multitool that consolidates multiple lateral-movement execution primitives behind a single CLI.  
- It targets common Windows remote management surfaces (WMI, DCOM, Task Scheduler, and SCMR) and emphasizes “OPSEC improvements” plus alternative RPC transports to better handle monitoring and firewall constraints.  
- The tool supports multiple authentication options including plaintext credentials, NTLM hash (pass-the-hash), Kerberos (including AES keys and ccache), and certificate-based auth (PFX).  
- It provides optional remote output collection by redirecting command output to a temp file and retrieving it over SMB (not recommended in monitored environments).  
- DCOM execution includes several COM object techniques (MMC20.Application, ShellWindows/ShellBrowserWindow, HTAFile URL monikers, and app-specific objects like Visual Studio DTE and Excel macro/XLL loading).  
- Task Scheduler methods include creating tasks with timed triggers, demanding immediate start, and temporarily modifying existing task definitions; SCMR supports create/change/delete service-based execution with multiple RPC binding options.  
- Useful primarily for red teams and pentesters needing flexible Windows remote execution paths and transport/auth variations for constrained environments.

Technical Focus:
- MSRPC/DCERPC transports, endpoint mapper (EPM) discovery, custom string bindings (ncacn_np, ncacn_ip_tcp)
- Remote execution via MS-WMI (Win32_Process.Create) and generic WMI method invocation
- DCOM-based execution via specific COM objects (MMC20.Application, ShellWindows, HTAFile/IPersistMoniker, VisualStudio.DTE, Excel.Application)
- MS-TSCH task registration/run/retrieve/modify (SchRpcRegisterTask, SchRpcRun, SchRpcRetrieveTask, SchRpcDelete)
- MS-SCMR service creation/modification (RCreateServiceW, RChangeServiceConfigW) for execution
- Authentication: NTLM (PTH), Kerberos (AES key/ccache), certificate (PFX), optional SMB output retrieval

Use Cases:
- Execute commands remotely over WMI/DCOM/SCMR/TSCH during lateral movement
- Operate in environments where SMB-based exec is blocked by using alternate RPC transports/bindings
- Run “living-off-the-land” commands and optionally collect output for triage (whoami, netstat, sc query, etc.)
- Leverage application-installed DCOM surfaces (Excel/Visual Studio) for niche execution paths
- Modify existing scheduled tasks or services for temporary execution and revert changes afterward
