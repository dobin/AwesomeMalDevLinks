Title:
Torpedo — “PsExec on Steroids” (C# SMB/SCCM Remote Execution Utility)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Torpedo is a C#-implemented PsExec-like remote execution tool for Windows that uses SMB (admin$) and SCCM-style service execution to run commands on remote hosts.  
- It focuses on stealthier tradecraft than classic PsExec by deploying an obfuscated/packed service, using named pipes for C2-style communication, and supporting encrypted, fileless DLL payload delivery executed in-memory via .NET reflection.  
- The tool includes token manipulation features: duplicating tokens from a target process by PID or creating tokens from supplied credentials (via P/Invoke), enabling execution under different security contexts.  
- It also performs basic target enumeration by remotely detecting the installed .NET Framework version over SMB to select compatible service payloads (net3.5/net4.5).  
- Post-execution cleanup is emphasized (service removal, binary deletion/shredding) to reduce artifacts.  
- Useful primarily for red teams and penetration testers needing lateral movement/remote execution in Windows environments while attempting to reduce common PsExec detections.

Technical Focus:
- SMB admin$ service deployment (PsExec-style lateral movement)
- Remote service creation/execution (SCCM-assisted execution model)
- Windows access token manipulation (token duplication / logon with creds)
- Named pipe IPC for payload transfer and output
- Fileless in-memory .NET DLL loading (reflection)
- Runtime encryption/polymorphism and artifact cleanup

Use Cases:
- Remote command execution on Windows hosts where admin$ access is available
- Lateral movement using service-based execution with token impersonation
- Fileless delivery/execution of .NET payloads over named pipes
- Running tools under stolen/duplicated tokens from specific PIDs
- Post-exploitation automation with cleanup to reduce forensic residue
