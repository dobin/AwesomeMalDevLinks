Title:
pipe-intercept — Intercept Windows Named Pipes communication using Burp (via WebSockets)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- A Windows-only Python tool that man-in-the-middles local Windows Named Pipe traffic by standing up a proxy pipe server/client and bridging messages over WebSockets.  
- It enables inspection and modification of named-pipe IPC using common HTTP proxy tooling (e.g., Burp Suite) by tunneling the pipe data through a WebSocket connection that Burp can observe/intercept.  
- The approach works by creating additional pipe server instances so that target clients connect to the proxy instance (FIFO behavior and permissions can affect which clients get intercepted).  
- The README highlights practical limitations: must run on the same Windows machine as the pipe server and proxy, may break apps using pipe endpoint identity checks, and can interfere with servers using `FILE_FLAG_FIRST_PIPE_INSTANCE`.  
- Useful for red teams/pentesters and security researchers assessing local IPC attack surface, authZ/authN logic, and message-level vulnerabilities in applications using named pipes (including RPC-like patterns).  
- Interesting because it brings “Burp-style” interactive interception to a non-HTTP Windows IPC channel that is commonly opaque during testing.

Technical Focus:
- Windows Named Pipes (Win32 API) proxying
- MITM via pipe server instance hijacking / FIFO connection behavior
- WebSocket bridge tunneled through an HTTP proxy (Burp)
- IPC message inspection and modification workflows
- Operational constraints: permissions, endpoint identity checks, `FILE_FLAG_FIRST_PIPE_INSTANCE`

Use Cases:
- Intercept and tamper with Docker Desktop’s `\\.\pipe\docker_engine` traffic for security testing
- Reverse engineer proprietary local IPC protocols carried over named pipes
- Identify auth bypasses or insecure message handling in pipe-based client/server apps
- Build reproducible test cases by capturing and replaying pipe messages through Burp
- Validate defensive controls that rely on pipe peer identity (PID/user) assumptions
