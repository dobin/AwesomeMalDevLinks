Title:
Spartacus DLL/COM Hijacking Toolkit

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Spartacus is a Windows-focused toolkit that automates discovery and exploitation workflow for DLL hijacking (sideloading) and local COM hijacking opportunities.  
- It solves the manual effort of hunting missing DLL loads / registry lookups by generating ProcMon filters, capturing long-running traces, parsing large PML logs, and exporting findings to CSV.  
- For DLL hijacking, it identifies NAME_NOT_FOUND/PATH_NOT_FOUND DLL load attempts, correlates which DLLs were ultimately loaded, and can auto-generate Visual Studio proxy DLL solutions for the targets.  
- For COM hijacking, it detects missing `InprocServer32` registry keys from ProcMon traces and can also enumerate the registry to find misconfigured COM entries (missing binaries and weak ACLs).  
- It includes a proxy-generation mode that can leverage Ghidra headless analysis to extract export signatures and execute payloads via proxied exports (not only `DllMain`).  
- Additional functionality includes generating self-signed certificates and signing DLLs, plus a basic “detect” mode to flag suspicious proxying based on module path heuristics.  
- Useful primarily for red teams and pentesters (tradecraft automation) and secondarily for defenders validating exposure and hunting for hijacking-in-progress patterns.

Technical Focus:
- Sysinternals ProcMon automation (PMC generation) and PML parsing at scale  
- DLL search order abuse / DLL sideloading and proxy DLL generation  
- COM hijacking via `InprocServer32` resolution and registry enumeration  
- Export forwarding and function-level proxying using Ghidra analyzeHeadless  
- Windows code signing: self-signed cert (PFX) generation and Authenticode signing  
- Module enumeration–based detection heuristics for suspicious DLL locations

Use Cases:
- Identify DLL hijacking candidates from long ProcMon captures (including multi-level dependency loads)
- Generate proxy DLL Visual Studio projects for rapid weaponization/testing
- Build function-proxy DLLs to trigger payloads from specific exports instead of `DllMain`
- Discover local COM hijack persistence/escalation paths via missing keys or weak ACLs
- Sign test payload DLLs with lookalike certificate metadata for lab/assessment scenarios
- Triage endpoints for potential active DLL proxying based on loaded module paths
