Title:
Customizing Sliver – Part 1 (Setting up the development environment)

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post is the first in a series aimed at helping readers contribute to the Sliver open-source C2 framework by understanding and modifying its codebase.  
- It focuses on setting up a reproducible development and debugging environment for Sliver’s server, client, and Windows implant.  
- The author walks through building Sliver from source, configuring VSCode launch profiles, and generating Go assets needed for development.  
- It also covers remote debugging of a Windows implant using Delve in headless mode and attaching from VSCode, then validating debugging by hitting breakpoints in implant handlers (e.g., `dirListHandler()` for `ls`).  
- This is primarily useful for red teamers, tool developers, and researchers who want to extend Sliver (e.g., adding commands/features) and need a practical workflow to test changes end-to-end.  
- It’s interesting because it demystifies Sliver’s dev loop (server/client/implant) and provides concrete configuration snippets that reduce friction when instrumenting implants during feature development.

Technical Focus:
- Building Sliver from source (Makefile workflow, go-assets generation)
- VSCode Go debugging configuration (launch.json/settings.json, build tags/ldflags)
- Protobuf toolchain setup (`protoc`) for Sliver development
- Remote debugging Windows Go binaries with Delve (`dlv` headless attach)
- Sliver operator/multiplayer setup and client config import
- Implant generation in debug mode and handler-level breakpointing

Use Cases:
- Add and test new Sliver commands while stepping through server/client/implant code
- Debug implant tasking/handler execution paths (e.g., file listing, command dispatch)
- Validate custom build flags/tags and version metadata during development
- Reproduce and troubleshoot Sliver compilation or runtime issues in a controlled setup
- Develop and verify new capabilities (e.g., port forwarding) with live debugging
