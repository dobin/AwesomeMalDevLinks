Title:
Introducing GoExec!

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post introduces **GoExec**, a Go-based remote execution tool intended as an OPSEC-focused, drop-in alternative to common Impacket exec scripts (psexec/smbexec/atexec/dcomexec/wmiexec).  
- It targets Windows lateral movement by implementing multiple **RPC-based** execution paths and emphasizing safer defaults (e.g., avoiding noisy calls, restoring modified artifacts, and enabling DCOM stub encryption).  
- The article details four primary modules: **SCMR (services)**, **TSCH (scheduled tasks)**, **DCOM**, and **WMI**, including “change” modes that modify existing services/tasks instead of creating new ones.  
- It highlights operational features like **native SOCKS5 proxy support**, configurable **MSRPC transports/endpoints** to handle port restrictions, and **extensive debug logging** via go-msrpc + zerolog.  
- Useful for red teamers and pentesters needing flexible remote execution tradecraft; also relevant to defenders for understanding lower-noise variants of common lateral movement techniques.

Technical Focus:
- MSRPC transports/endpoints and dynamic RPC connection configuration  
- SCMR service creation vs service reconfiguration (RCreateServiceW/RChangeServiceConfigW)  
- Task Scheduler RPC tradecraft (SchRpcRegisterTask, avoiding SchRpcRun/Delete, task restoration)  
- DCOM remote activation and **RPC stub encryption**  
- WMI remote process creation (Win32_Process.Create)  
- Proxy-aware lateral movement (SOCKS5)

Use Cases:
- Lateral movement / remote command execution in Active Directory environments
- Executing via existing services or scheduled tasks to reduce “new object” artifacts
- Operating through SOCKS5 pivots without external proxy tooling
- Bypassing network/port constraints by changing RPC transport/endpoint selection
- Troubleshooting and research using verbose RPC/debug logging
