Title:
Phantom (Crybat/Jlaive Rewrite) – AV Evasion Batch Crypter/Stub Builder

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Phantom is an antivirus evasion/crypter-style tool that transforms executables into batch-based droppers/loaders intended to reduce static detection (with limited guarantees for .NET/native payloads).  
- It focuses on packaging and protecting payloads via AES encryption and compression, then executing through a stub with multiple anti-analysis features.  
- The project advertises defenses against common Windows telemetry and scanning surfaces, including AMSI and ETW bypasses, plus anti-debug and anti-VM checks.  
- It also includes post-execution behaviors such as self-deletion (“melt”), file binding, persistence (startup), and a UAC bypass option.  
- This is primarily useful for red team operators, malware analysts, and defenders studying commodity evasion tradecraft and how batch/stub-based loaders are assembled.  
- It’s interesting as a consolidated example of multiple evasion/persistence techniques in a C#-centric builder workflow, with accompanying technical documentation PDF.

Technical Focus:
- Payload encryption (AES) and compression in droppers/stubs  
- Batch file wrapping / executable-to-BAT conversion techniques  
- AMSI bypass and script/content scanning evasion  
- ETW bypass / telemetry suppression  
- Anti-debugging and anti-VM/sandbox checks  
- Persistence and UAC bypass tradecraft

Use Cases:
- Building test payload wrappers to evaluate AV/EDR detection and response
- Studying common loader/crypter implementation patterns (builder + stub)
- Reproducing and validating AMSI/ETW bypass detections in a lab
- Generating samples for defensive research (static/dynamic signatures, behavior rules)
- Assessing how encryption/compression and self-delete affect forensic visibility
