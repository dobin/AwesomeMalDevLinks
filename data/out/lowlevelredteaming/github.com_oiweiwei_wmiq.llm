Title:
wmiq — Remote WMI query command-line utility (DCOM/DCERPC)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- wmiq is a Go-based CLI tool that performs remote Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) queries over the network using DCOM/DCERPC.  
- It solves the need for a cross-platform (notably Linux-friendly) alternative to WMIC/PowerShell for executing WQL queries against remote Windows hosts.  
- The tool supports multiple authentication options (username/password, NTLM hash, Kerberos via ccache/AES key, and PFX-based auth) and can use either TCP/IP or SMB named-pipe transport.  
- It includes operational features like SOCKS5 proxying, JSON/YAML output, debug tracing, and enumeration tuning (page size, limits, forward-only).  
- Useful for red teams and pentesters for remote host reconnaissance and environment discovery via WMI; also relevant to blue teams for understanding WMI/DCOM exposure and query patterns.  
- Interesting because it combines AD-focused auth handling (adauth) with a Go MSRPC stack to implement WMI querying without relying on Windows-native tooling.

Technical Focus:
- WMI / WQL querying (e.g., Win32_Process, Win32_Service, Win32_OperatingSystem)
- DCOM + DCERPC/MSRPC communication
- Authentication: Kerberos (ccache, AES key), NTLM (pass-the-hash), username/password, PFX
- Transport options: TCP vs SMB named pipes
- Proxying via SOCKS5 for routed access
- Enumeration performance controls (paging, forward-only, result limiting)

Use Cases:
- Remote process/service/OS inventory on Windows servers and workstations
- Querying AD-related WMI namespaces (e.g., root/directory/ldap) for directory recon
- Operating through pivot infrastructure using SOCKS5 to reach internal hosts
- Pass-the-hash or Kerberos-ticket-based WMI recon in AD environments
- Collecting structured output (JSON/YAML) for automation and reporting pipelines
