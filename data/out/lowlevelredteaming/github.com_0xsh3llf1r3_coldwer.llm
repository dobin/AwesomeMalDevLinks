Title:
ColdWer — Cobalt Strike BOF to freeze EDR/AV and dump LSASS via WerFaultSecure.exe PPL bypass

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- ColdWer is a Cobalt Strike Beacon Object File (BOF) that uses a WerFaultSecure.exe Protected Process Light (PPL) bypass to temporarily “freeze” EDR/AV user-mode processes and to dump LSASS memory on modern Windows systems.  
- It operationalizes prior research (EDR-Freeze and WSASS) by launching WerFaultSecure.exe at WinTcb PPL, attaching to a target process, and leveraging MiniDumpWriteDump behavior that suspends target threads.  
- By suspending WerFaultSecure after it has suspended the target, the target process remains effectively paused, creating a window to run post-exploitation actions with reduced user-mode monitoring.  
- For LSASS dumping, it relies on using a Windows 8.1 WerFaultSecure binary to produce an unencrypted/raw dump (Windows 10/11 versions produce encrypted dumps).  
- The workflow includes restoring the dump header (PNG → MDMP) before parsing with tools like Mimikatz.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teams and offensive security researchers; it explicitly notes it won’t work against EDRs with kernel-mode self-protection (e.g., CrowdStrike, SentinelOne).

Technical Focus:
- WerFaultSecure.exe abuse for PPL (WinTcb) bypass
- EDR “freeze” via thread suspension side-effects of MiniDumpWriteDump
- LSASS memory dumping under PPL constraints
- Cobalt Strike BOF + Aggressor script integration
- Dump format/header manipulation (PNG magic → MDMP)
- Limitations vs kernel-mode self-protection / tamper protection

Use Cases:
- Freeze Microsoft Defender (MsMpEng.exe) or other user-mode protected processes during an operation
- Dump LSASS on hosts where standard handle access is blocked by PPL
- Create a short-lived window to run credential theft tooling (e.g., Mimikatz/Rubeus) with reduced interference
- Research/validation of PPL bypass and user-mode EDR suspension techniques in lab environments
