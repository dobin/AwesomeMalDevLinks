Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- OpenMalleableC2 is an open-source, framework-agnostic library that implements Cobalt Strike’s Malleable C2 profile format specifically for HTTP request/response transformations.  
- It solves the gap in many open-source C2 frameworks where HTTP traffic customization is less expressive than Cobalt Strike’s ability to embed beacon data into “legitimate-looking” web traffic.  
- The project enables reuse of existing Malleable C2 profiles (and related ecosystem tools like profile generators) to encode/decode arbitrary data over HTTP in a consistent way.  
- It includes example code (a “ping-pong” agent/server) demonstrating typical beacon-style GET check-ins and POST task output flows driven by a chosen profile (e.g., a gmail-themed profile).  
- It’s primarily useful for red teams and security researchers building custom agents/C2s, and secondarily for defenders who want to understand and emulate malleable HTTP patterns for testing detections.  
- The author notes it is “mostly working” but not guaranteed stable, implying ongoing validation and edge-case handling may be needed.

Technical Focus:
- Cobalt Strike Malleable C2 profile parsing and execution
- HTTP transformation pipelines (encoding/embedding callback data)
- Beacon-like callback patterns (GET tasking / POST results)
- Profile-driven request shaping (headers, URIs, body structure)
- Interoperability with existing Malleable C2 profile repositories/tools

Use Cases:
- Integrate Malleable C2-style HTTP shaping into a custom C2 framework or agent
- Rapidly prototype “legitimate-looking” HTTP C2 traffic using existing profiles
- Build test harnesses to evaluate proxy/IDS/EDR detections against malleable HTTP patterns
- Reproduce and study Cobalt Strike-like network behaviors without using Cobalt Strike
