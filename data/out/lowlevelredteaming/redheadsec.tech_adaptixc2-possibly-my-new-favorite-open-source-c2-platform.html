      <div class="post__content">
        <p>As an offensive security consultant, I've had my fair share of experience with command and control frameworks. Everything from commercial products such as Cobalt Strike to open-source frameworks such as <a href="https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver?ref=redheadsec.tech" rel="noreferrer">Sliver</a> and <a href="https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic?ref=redheadsec.tech" rel="noreferrer">Mythic</a>. There are tons of options in the space, each with their own little pros and cons. Hearing about another C2 generally does not make the news for me but AdaptixC2 was the exception. I generally try to avoid the use of any full feature C2 in current operations, preferring to live off the land or used specialized tools such as <a href="https://github.com/boku7/Loki?ref=redheadsec.tech" rel="noreferrer">Loki</a> that currently fly under the radar with far greater success than Cobalt Strike or Sliver. I am also not really versed in the development department, so building full in house implementations of C2 servers and clients is just outside the available time I have to learn and commit while performing non-stop work and life. Generally, this is where I'd consider the two most popular open source tools like Mythic and Sliver come into play. Due to the very modular nature of Mythic's design, the ease of building an agent to plug n play with the server is far more streamlined that other platforms, allowing operators to build custom loaders that can perform any number of needed evasion techniques to load code. Sadly, I personally am not a huge fan of Mythic's UI setup (It was updated recently which I am more fond of now) and the pain of debugging inside multiple docker containers and services can get cumbersome. While Sliver was my favorite choice in the past due to the Armory and easy setup, its slower development time and lack of a GUI can be a turn off for some situations. Until now, Mythic was really the only open source C2 in play for most adversarial engagements in my opinion but that may be changing! This is where AdaptixC2 comes in, providing the clean interface similar if not better than Cobalt Strike's while allowing for custom agents and modularity. In this post, I will be going over the basics of v0.5 currently released, the features. and creating custom extensions. </p><h1 id="adaptixc2overview">AdaptixC2 - Overview</h1><p>AdaptixC2 can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/Adaptix-Framework/AdaptixC2/tree/main?ref=redheadsec.tech">https://github.com/Adaptix-Framework/AdaptixC2/tree/main</a></p><p>"Adaptix is an extensible post-exploitation and adversarial emulation framework made for penetration testers.

Installation is pretty straight forward and covered well here: <a href="https://adaptix-framework.gitbook.io/adaptix-framework/adaptix-c2/getting-starting/installation?ref=redheadsec.tech">https://adaptix-framework.gitbook.io/adaptix-framework/adaptix-c2/getting-starting/installation</a></p><h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1><p>Once you have the compiled server and client, you'll want to configure your C2 server profile. This is different than what you normally expect out of profiles such as Cobalt Strike or Nighthawk, which have everything tied together. Here, AdaptixC2 has a server profile which looks like the following:</p><pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">┌──(root㉿DEV-kali)-[/opt/AdaptixC2/dist]
└─# cat profile.json   
{
  "Teamserver": {
    "port": 4321,
    "endpoint": "/endpoint",
    "password": "pass",
    "cert": "server.rsa.crt",
    "key": "server.rsa.key",
    "extenders": [
      "extenders/listener_beacon_http/config.json",
      "extenders/listener_beacon_smb/config.json",
      "extenders/listener_beacon_tcp/config.json",
      "extenders/agent_beacon/config.json",
      "extenders/listener_gopher_tcp/config.json",
      "extenders/agent_gopher/config.json"
    ]
  },

  "ServerResponse": {
    "status": 404,
    "headers": {
      "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8",
      "Server": "AdaptixC2",
      "Adaptix Version": "v0.3"
    },
    "page": "404page.html"
  }
} </code></pre><p>This will set the settings for connecting via the client such as the endpoint URI, password, loaded extenders (listeners and agents), and server response traffic. You can set these via the command line as well if desired but I'd always recommend using a configuration JSON file. Multiplayer is supported out of the box as the server uses one password with the client allowing users to join with an alias, similar to Cobalt Strike. Once you have it ready, you can run it using the <code>--profile &lt;config&gt;</code> flag. </p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">❗</div><div class="kg-callout-text">OPSEC NOTE: Always put your teamsevers behind redirectors and ACLs to ensure it is not being hit by unwanted eyes when using any C2 in production.</div></div><pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">└─# ./adaptixserver --profile profile.json -debug

Open the listeners tab, right click on the console pane, and select "Create". You'll be greeted by the following window:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://redheadsec.tech/content/images/2025/05/image-3.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="648" height="707" data-action="zoom"></figure><p>Here is where I find AdaptixC2 current lacks the greatest in terms of default customization. This window allows to define a listener based on the current loaded extenders on the server. Recall that part of the building process was the <code>make extenders</code> command that were compiled and loaded into your /dist directory. The default is the BeaconHTTP listener which allows you to specify callback hosts, a single URI, user-agent, and other aspects such as headers or responses. Ideally we want to be able to dynamically create callback URIs or select from a list that can then dynamically create data to avoid getting fingerprinted by network traffic scanners or an analyst. I plan to look into custom plugin development or a PR to enhance these features but for now we can go with a good ol default testing profile. The other options here are gopher TCP agents which are compatible with all major operating systems and bind agents which are your peer to peer agents which I will go over shortly.  If you select <code>Use SSL (HTTPS)</code>, it will generate a self-signed certificate if you do not provide one. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://redheadsec.tech/content/images/2025/05/image-4.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="650" height="704" data-action="zoom"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Sample HTTP Profile</span></figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://redheadsec.tech/content/images/2025/05/image-5.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="649" height="161" data-action="zoom"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Running Listener</span></figcaption></figure><p>Next we need to create an agent for this listener, right click the listener and hit <code>Generate Agent</code>. This will bring up the agent build window for that particular listener. Each listener is tied to specific agent plugins which vary in functionality. Be sure to overview these and choose what is best for your current situation. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://redheadsec.tech/content/images/2025/05/image-6.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="451" height="568" data-action="zoom"></figure><p>BeaconHTTP are Windows only currently so we will be testing against another lab host on my Ludus network. On the generate agent window, we can set architecture, format (exe, dll, shellcode, service exe), sleep &amp; jitter, along with kill dates and working times. Kill date will terminate the agent once it hits the specified time and date while working times will ensure your beacon is only active during specific time periods. Another great feature here and on the listener windows are the load and save configuration buttons on the top right, allowing you to save and load profiles that you have built. I will keep everything default here and hit generate. Save to the location of your choice, then move to a Windows host for testing. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://redheadsec.tech/content/images/2025/05/image-7.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="709" height="421" data-action="zoom"></figure><p>This box has all protections disabled. Be warned that this code is not OPSEC safe out of the box and has no built in evasion features for default agent plugins so don't expect to go own a fortune 500 off the bat with this. Run the program and you should see a callback:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://redheadsec.tech/content/images/2025/05/image-8.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="442" data-action="zoom"></figure><p>Perfect now we have something to work with. Lets right click the new beacon and go into the console. You may notice other awesome features here such as the ability to browse files and processes via the GUI, create tunnels, and view tasks. You can also do some organizational operations such as set tags, change colors, hide beacons, and mark activity.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://redheadsec.tech/content/images/2025/05/image-12.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1064" height="497" data-action="zoom"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">File Explorer</span></figcaption></figure><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://redheadsec.tech/content/images/2025/05/image-13.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1728" height="632" data-action="zoom"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Process Explorer</span></figcaption></figure><p> You can use the <code>help</code> command to list currently loaded commands and extensions.

Perform a <code>git clone </code><a href="https://github.com/Adaptix-Framework/Extension-Kit.git?ref=redheadsec.tech"><code>https://github.com/Adaptix-Framework/Extension-Kit.git</code></a> then run <code>for d in */ ; do (cd "$d" &amp;&amp; make); done</code> to make all the current extensions (<strong>assuming you have all the needed dependencies installed!</strong>).
