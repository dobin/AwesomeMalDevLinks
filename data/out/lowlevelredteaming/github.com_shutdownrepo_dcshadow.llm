ShutdownRepo/dcshadow (Python alternative to Mimikatz lsadump::dcshadow)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository implements the Active Directory DCShadow technique in pure Python as an alternative to Mimikatz’s `lsadump::dcshadow`.  
- It stands up a “rogue DC” that temporarily registers as a domain controller and uses AD replication (DRSUAPI) to push crafted attribute changes into a legitimate DC, enabling stealthy persistence.  
- The project ships with a custom/modified Impacket (notably `crypto`, `gssapi`, `drsuapi`) to support the required Kerberos/RPC replication flows.  
- Workflow includes creating a machine account, adding a DNS record for reachability, providing Kerberos keys for the rogue DC account, and executing replication changes via a JSON plan or inline parameters.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teams and AD security researchers to reproduce DCShadow behavior, and for blue teams to generate telemetry/IoCs and validate detections in lab environments (explicitly not for production).  
- Interesting because it makes DCShadow experimentation more accessible outside Windows/Mimikatz and highlights replication-based persistence as a “transport” for other AD abuses (SIDHistory, DACL/ACE abuse, KRBTGT/RBCD-related scenarios).

Technical Focus:
- DCShadow / rogue domain controller registration and unregistration
- Active Directory replication via DRSUAPI (e.g., DRSReplicaAdd) over MSRPC
- Kerberos authentication (RC4/AES keys) and GSSAPI/SPNEGO handling
- Impacket modifications for replication and auth edge-cases
- AD object/attribute manipulation via replication (JSON-driven changes)
- Supporting steps: machine account creation (LDAP/LDAPS) and DNS record injection

Use Cases:
- Lab simulation of DCShadow persistence to test SOC detections and incident response playbooks
- Red team AD persistence by replicating malicious attribute changes into a DC
- Researching/validating replication abuse primitives (SIDHistory injection, DACL changes, delegation-related persistence)
- Building or extending an AD persistence framework around replication “transport”
- Generating network/host telemetry for detection engineering (RPC endpoint mapper, DRSUAPI patterns)
