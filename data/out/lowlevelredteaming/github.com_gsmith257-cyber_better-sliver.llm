Title:
Better-Sliver (fork of BishopFox Sliver)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Better-Sliver is an archived fork of the Sliver adversary emulation/C2 framework focused on reducing detectability by changing default fingerprints and breaking static signatures.  
- It targets common defensive detections by modifying implant/server TLS artifacts (custom CAs), altering command strings that appear in YARA/behavior rules, and adding protocol fingerprint randomization.  
- The repo highlights how brittle static signature-based detections can be against minor source-level changes in a widely used open-source C2.  
- Notable changes include JARM randomization (later added upstream in Sliver v1.6 dev), adjustments to Donut/go-donut behavior (e.g., not attempting AMSI bypass by default), and attempts at beacon sleepmasking (removed due to bugs).  
- Useful for red teams and security researchers evaluating EDR/network detection resilience and for blue teams validating detection logic against variant builds.  

Technical Focus:
- Sliver C2/implant customization and rebuilds (Go)
- Static signature evasion (YARA/byte-pattern breaking)
- TLS/mTLS fingerprint changes (custom CA material)
- JARM fingerprint randomization
- Donut/go-donut shellcode generation and related detection surfaces
- Beacon OPSEC features (sleepmasking experimentation)

Use Cases:
- Build Sliver variants to test EDR and network detection robustness
- Validate/strengthen YARA and behavioral detections against trivial string/fingerprint changes
- Research protocol fingerprinting (JARM) and countermeasures
- Compare upstream Sliver vs modified forks to identify stable detection anchors
