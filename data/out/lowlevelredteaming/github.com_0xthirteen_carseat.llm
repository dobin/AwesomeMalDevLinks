Title:
Carseat – A Junior Seatbelt (Python implementation of GhostPack Seatbelt)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Carseat is a Python reimplementation of GhostPack’s Seatbelt focused on “situational awareness” enumeration of Windows hosts.  
- It aims to provide most Seatbelt modules that support remote execution, enabling operators to query security posture, configuration, and user/artifact data over the network.  
- The tool leverages Impacket-style authentication options (passwords, NTLM hashes, Kerberos tickets) and uses WMI/registry/event log querying to collect results.  
- It includes a large set of modules covering AV/Defender, AppLocker, UAC, firewall rules, Sysmon, logon/process creation events, scheduled tasks, shares, LAPS, WSUS/SCCM, browser artifacts, and cloud credential file discovery.  
- Useful primarily for red teams and pentesters doing post-compromise host triage and remote enumeration; also relevant to blue teams for understanding what can be remotely collected and how.  
- Interesting because it brings Seatbelt-like coverage to Python/Impacket workflows, making it easier to integrate into existing offensive automation and remote ops.

Technical Focus:
- Remote Windows enumeration via Impacket (SMB/RPC/WMI)  
- Registry and WMI-based configuration discovery  
- Windows Event Log parsing (e.g., 4624/4648/4688/4104, Sysmon EID 1)  
- Security control posture checks (Defender, AppLocker, AMSI, UAC, CredGuard, Secure Boot)  
- Artifact collection (browser history/bookmarks, RDP/Putty/KeePass/FileZilla, PowerShell history)  
- Enterprise management surface enumeration (SCCM, WSUS, WEF, OneDrive/Cloud sync)

Use Cases:
- Remote host triage to identify defensive tooling, logging coverage, and hardening gaps
- Enumerate credential/artifact sources (DPAPI keys, browser data, PowerShell history, cloud creds)
- Assess lateral movement constraints (firewall rules, RDP settings, NTLM settings, local groups/users)
- Identify persistence opportunities (scheduled tasks, autoruns) and monitoring exposure (Sysmon/WEF)
- Collect recent security-relevant activity from event logs (logons, explicit creds, process creation)
