Title:
Fibratus — Adversary tradecraft detection, protection, and hunting (Windows)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Fibratus is a Windows security monitoring and detection tool focused on identifying adversary tradecraft by collecting and analyzing low-level system events.  
- It applies a behavior-driven rules engine (with MITRE mapping support) and includes a YARA-based memory scanner to detect suspicious activity beyond simple log-based indicators.  
- The project supports real-time detection/alerting, event capture for offline forensics, and exporting telemetry to multiple output sinks.  
- It can be extended via “filaments,” which allow custom Python-based tooling and automation on top of the event stream.  
- This is primarily useful for Blue Teams, threat hunters, and detection engineers, but also valuable for red teams to validate OPSEC and measure detection coverage.  
- Its interest lies in combining ETW-style system visibility, behavioral correlation, and memory scanning in a single, extensible pipeline.

Technical Focus:
- Windows event collection/instrumentation (kernel/system telemetry)
- Behavior-based detection rules engine (sequence/correlation)
- YARA memory scanning
- Alerting/output sinks (e.g., Windows Event Log, JSON)
- Capture files for offline analysis/forensics
- Python extensibility via filaments

Use Cases:
- Build and run behavioral detections for common attacker TTPs on Windows endpoints
- Threat hunting using high-fidelity system event streams and rule matches
- Memory scanning for in-memory artifacts using YARA rules
- Capture/record endpoint activity for incident response and post-compromise forensics
- Extend detection/response workflows with custom Python filaments
- Red-team detection testing (e.g., validate whether actions like credential discovery trigger alerts)
