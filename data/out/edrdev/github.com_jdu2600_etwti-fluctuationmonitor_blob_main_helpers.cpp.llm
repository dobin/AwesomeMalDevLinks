Title:
EtwTi-FluctuationMonitor (helpers.cpp)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository appears to be a Windows monitoring utility focused on detecting “fluctuations” related to ETW-TI (Event Tracing for Windows – Threat Intelligence), often discussed in the context of EDR visibility and tampering.  
- The provided `helpers.cpp` contains utility functions used by the main monitor: one converts Windows memory page protection constants into compact “R/W/X” strings, and another resolves a PID to a process image name via `OpenProcess(PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION)` and `QueryFullProcessImageNameW`.  
- These helpers support reporting/telemetry output (e.g., showing which process and what memory protections are involved when events are observed).  
- It’s useful for red teamers and security researchers investigating ETW/ETW-TI behavior, and for blue teamers validating detection logic around process/memory activity.  
- The interesting aspect is the focus on correlating process identity and memory protection states—common pivots when analyzing injection, code staging, or telemetry suppression attempts.

Technical Focus:
- Windows process querying (OpenProcess, QueryFullProcessImageNameW)
- PID-to-image-name resolution and path handling (std::filesystem)
- Memory protection flag decoding (PAGE_* → R/W/X)
- Minimal-privilege process inspection (PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION)

Use Cases:
- Enrich ETW/ETW-TI monitoring output with human-readable process names
- Display/triage memory region protections during suspicious activity analysis
- Support research into telemetry changes potentially caused by ETW/EDR tampering
- Build lightweight process/memory reporting components for Windows security tools
