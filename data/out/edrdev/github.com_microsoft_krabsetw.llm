Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- KrabsETW is a modern C++ library that wraps low-level Windows Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) trace consumption APIs to simplify enabling providers, managing traces, and receiving event callbacks.  
- It addresses the complexity of directly using ETW consumer functions by providing higher-level abstractions for sessions, providers, and event handling, plus helpers to parse generic ETW payloads into strongly typed fields.  
- The repo also includes a C++/CLI-based .NET wrapper (Microsoft.O365.Security.Native.ETW, “Lobsters”) used in production by the Office 365 Security team, enabling ETW consumption from .NET applications.  
- Documentation includes an ETW primer and examples for both native and managed usage, including guidance on discovering ETW sources.  
- Useful for Blue Teams building telemetry/detections, EDR/security engineers, and Red Teams needing custom ETW-based visibility or research tooling.  
- Interesting because it provides a practical, production-backed ETW consumer framework with both native and .NET support (x64/ARM64) and NuGet distribution.

Technical Focus:
- ETW trace consumption (user-mode consumers)
- Provider/session management and event callback pipelines
- Parsing EVENT_RECORD payloads into typed schemas
- C++ wrapper abstractions over Windows ETW APIs
- C++/CLI and .NET (NuGet) interop for ETW
- Windows x64/ARM64 support considerations and threading/blocking trace start

Use Cases:
- Build custom Windows telemetry collectors for detections and hunting
- Prototype ETW-based sensors for process/network/file activity providers
- Create .NET security tooling that subscribes to ETW providers in real time
- Research and validate what ETW events are emitted by specific components/providers
- Develop internal diagnostics/performance/security monitoring agents
