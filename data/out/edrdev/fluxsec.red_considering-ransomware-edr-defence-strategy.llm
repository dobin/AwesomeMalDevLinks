Title:
Real-time Ransomware Detection Strategy (Sanctum EDR)

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- The post outlines a theory-driven approach for detecting ransomware in real time as part of the author’s Sanctum EDR project.  
- It proposes using a Windows filesystem minifilter driver to intercept file I/O and identify processes that rapidly modify many files, especially when overwriting headers/magic bytes or changing extensions.  
- Upon suspected ransomware behavior, the response workflow is to freeze the process, capture a memory dump for key/forensic extraction and reverse engineering, then terminate and alert a telemetry server.  
- It also suggests fleet-wide containment: notifying other agents to lock down or block execution based on shared metadata (hash/signature/filename/command line).  
- Key challenges noted are EDR-killer malware (out of scope) and distinguishing ransomware from legitimate on-the-fly encryption tools (e.g., VeraCrypt), with the hypothesis that filesystem “walk + bulk rewrite” patterns are a differentiator.  
- The work depends on exposing missing filesystem APIs in windows-drivers-rs via a pending PR to enable Rust-based driver development.

Technical Focus:
- Windows minifilter drivers (filesystem I/O interception)
- Behavioral ransomware detection via bulk file modification patterns
- File header/magic-byte tampering as a signal
- Automated incident response: process freeze, memory dump, kill, telemetry
- Rust Windows driver development (windows-drivers-rs / WDK bindings)

Use Cases:
- Implementing ransomware behavioral detection in an EDR agent
- Building kernel-assisted telemetry for high-fidelity file-write monitoring
- Automated containment and forensic capture during active encryption events
- Baseline testing against mock ransomware vs legitimate encryption software
- Fleet-wide rapid blocking using shared indicators/metadata
