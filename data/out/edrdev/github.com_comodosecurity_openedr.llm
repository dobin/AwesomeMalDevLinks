GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- OpenEDR is an open-source Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agent and telemetry pipeline intended to provide deep endpoint visibility and detection at “base security event” granularity.  
- It solves the problem of collecting and correlating endpoint telemetry (process, file, registry, and network activity) to support investigation, root-cause analysis, and alerting.  
- The repo describes a multi-component architecture including a Windows service, kernel-mode monitoring (minifilter and callback-based process/registry monitoring), network filtering, and user-mode API hooking via injected DLLs.  
- Telemetry is stored locally and forwarded to self-hosted or cloud ElasticSearch/ELK stacks (with setup docs for Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Filebeat).  
- It’s useful for Blue Teams/SOC engineers building detections and for security researchers/red teamers who want to study EDR collection methods, coverage, and potential blind spots.  
- It’s interesting because it exposes a relatively complete EDR implementation (user-mode + kernel-mode sensors plus self-protection) that can be audited, extended, and used for defensive engineering.

Technical Focus:
- Windows kernel telemetry collection (minifilter, system callbacks)
- User-mode API hooking via injected DLL + driver-assisted loading
- Process hierarchy tracking and event correlation
- Network activity monitoring via filtering components
- ELK/ElasticSearch-based telemetry ingestion and visualization
- Self-protection mechanisms for agent integrity

Use Cases:
- Deploy an open EDR sensor feeding ElasticSearch/Kibana for endpoint visibility
- Build and test detection/alerting policies on rich endpoint telemetry
- Research EDR sensor design (kernel callbacks, minifilters, injection-based hooks)
- Validate attacker TTP visibility gaps (process, file, registry, network) in lab environments
- Create custom integrations/dashboards around OpenEDR event schemas
