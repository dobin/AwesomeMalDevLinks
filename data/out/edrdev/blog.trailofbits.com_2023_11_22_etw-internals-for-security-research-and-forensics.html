The answer lies in the value of the intelligence it provides to security tools through secure ETW channels, which are now also a target for offensive researchers looking to bypass detections.</p><p>In this deep dive, we’re not just discussing ETW’s functionalities; we’re exploring how ETW works internally so you can conduct novel research or forensic analysis on a system. Security researchers and malware authors already target ETW. They have developed several <a href="https://www.binarly.io/posts/Design_issues_of_modern_EDRs_bypassing_ETW-based_solutions/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">techniques</a> to <a href="https://blog.palantir.com/tampering-with-windows-event-tracing-background-offense-and-defense-4be7ac62ac63" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tamper with</a> or <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/x-force/direct-kernel-object-manipulation-attacks-etw-providers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bypass</a> ETW-based EDRs, <a href="https://github.com/everdox/InfinityHook/blob/master/README.md" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hook system calls</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/pathtofile/SealighterTI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">gain access</a> to ETW providers normally reserved for anti-malware solutions. Most recently, the Lazarus Group bypassed EDR detection by <a href="https://www.virusbulletin.com/uploads/pdf/conference/vb2022/papers/VB2022-Lazarus-and-BYOVD-evil-to-the-Windows-core.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">disabling ETW providers</a>. Here, we’ll explain how ETW works and what makes it such a tempting target, and we’ll embark on an exciting journey deep into Windows.</p><h2>Overview of ETW internals</h2><p>Two main components of ETW are providers and consumers. Providers send events to an ETW globally unique identifier (GUID), and the events are written to a file, a buffer in memory, or both. Every Windows system has hundreds or thousands of providers registered. We can view available providers by running the command <code>logman query providers</code>:</p><p><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/11/22/etw-internals-for-security-research-and-forensics/71022bb581f62b933314a70df56dce1d.png"></p><p>By checking my system, we can see there are nearly 1,200 registered providers:</p><p><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/11/22/etw-internals-for-security-research-and-forensics/570aad5b5618105a7490f1369c69123f.png"></p><p>Each of these ETW providers defines its own events in a manifest file, which is used by consumers to parse provider-generated data. ETW providers may define hundreds of different event types, so the amount of information we can get from ETW is enormous. Most of these events can be seen in Event Viewer, a built-in Windows tool that consumes ETW events. But you’ll only see some of the data. Not all logs are enabled by default in Event Viewer, and not all event IDs are shown for each log.</p><p>On the other side we have consumers: trace logging sessions that receive events from one or several providers. For example, EDRs that rely on ETW data for their detection will consume events from security-related ETW channels such as the <a href="https://jsecurity101.medium.com/uncovering-windows-events-b4b9db7eac54" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Threat Intelligence</a> channel.</p><p>We can look at all running ETW consumers via Performance Monitor; clicking one of the sessions will show the providers it subscribes to. (You may need to run as SYSTEM to see all ETW logging sessions.)</p><p><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/11/22/etw-internals-for-security-research-and-forensics/78606875c18274c4ddeaa156799c74c3.png"></p><p>The list of processes that receive events from this log session is useful information but not easy to obtain. As far as I could see there is no way to get that information from user mode at all, and even from kernel mode it’s not an easy task unless you are very familiar with ETW internals. So we will see what we can learn from a kernel debugging session using WinDbg.</p><h2>Finding ETW consumer processes</h2><p>There are ways to find consumers of ETW log sessions from user mode. However, they only supply very partial information that isn’t enough in all cases. So instead, we’ll head to our kernel debugger session. One way to get information about ETW sessions from the debugger is using the built-in extension <code>!wmitrace</code>. This extremely useful extension allows users to investigate all of the running loggers and their attributes, consumers, and buffers. It even allows users to start and stop log sessions (on a live debugger connection). Still, like all legacy extensions, it has its limitations: it can’t be easily automated, and since it’s a precompiled binary it can’t be extended with new functionality.</p><p>So instead we’ll write a JavaScript script—scripts are easier to extend and modify, and we can use them to get as much data as we need without being limited to the preexisting functionality of a legacy extension.</p><p>Every handle contains a pointer to an object. For example, a file handle will point to a kernel structure of type <code>FILE_OBJECT</code>. A handle to an object of type <code>EtwConsumer</code> will point to an undocumented data structure called <code><a href="https://www.vergiliusproject.com/kernels/x64/Windows%207%20%7C%202008R2/SP1/_ETW_REALTIME_CONSUMER" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ETW_REALTIME_CONSUMER</a></code>. This structure contains a pointer to the process that opened it, events that get notified for different actions, flags, and also one piece of information that will (eventually) lead us back to the log session—<code>LoggerId</code>. Using a custom script, we can scan the handle tables of all processes for handles to <code>EtwConsumer</code> objects. For each one, we can get the linked <code>ETW_REALTIME_CONSUMER</code> structure and print the <code>LoggerId</code>:</p><pre>"use strict";

function initializeScript()
{
    return [new host.apiVersionSupport(1, 7)];
}


function EtwConsumersForProcess(process)
{
    let dbgOutput = host.diagnostics.debugLog;
    let handles = process.Io.Handles;

    try 
    {
        for (let handle of handles)
        {
            try
            {
                let objType = handle.Object.ObjectType;
                if (objType === "EtwConsumer")
                {
                    let consumer = host.createTypedObject(handle.Object.Body.address, "nt", "_ETW_REALTIME_CONSUMER");
                    let loggerId = consumer.LoggerId;

                    dbgOutput("Process ", process.Name, " with ID ", process.Id, " has handle ", handle.Handle, " to Logger ID ", loggerId, "\n");
                }
            } catch (e) {
                dbgOutput("\tException parsing handle ", handle.Handle, "in process ", process.Name, "!\n");
            }
        }
    } catch (e) {

    }
}</pre><p>Next, we load the script into the debugger with <code>.scriptload</code> and call our function to identify which process consumes ETW events:</p><pre>dx @$cursession.Processes.Select(p =&gt; @$scriptContents.EtwConsumersForProcess(p))

</pre><p>While we still don’t get the name of the log sessions, we already have more data than we did in user mode. We can see, for example, that some processes have multiple consumer handles since they are subscribed to multiple log sessions. Unfortunately, the <code>ETW_REALTIME_CONSUMER</code> structure doesn’t have any information about the log session besides its identifier, so we must find a way to match identifiers to human-readable names.</p><p>The registered loggers and their IDs are stored in a global list of loggers (or at least they were until the introduction of <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/what-i-learned-from-reverse-engineering-windows-containers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">server silos</a>; now, every isolated process will have its own separate ETW loggers while non-isolated processes will use the global list, which I will also use in this post).

</pre><p>Visually, this is what this whole thing looks like:</p><p><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/11/22/etw-internals-for-security-research-and-forensics/8c8dd7ae81f828487862b39d620296cf.png"></p><p>As we can see, the <code>ETW_GUID_ENTRY</code> structure contains a <code>LoggerId</code> field, which we can use as the index into the <code>EtwpLoggerContext</code> array to find the log session.</p><p>With this new information in mind, we can write a simple JavaScript function to print the GUIDs that match a logger ID. (In this case, I chose to go over only one <code>ETW_GUID_TYPE</code> at a time to make this code a bit cleaner.) Then we can go one step further and parse the <code>ETW_REG_ENTRY</code> list in each GUID entry to find out which processes notify it, or if it’s a kernel-mode provider:</p><pre>function GetGuidsForLoggerId(loggerId, guidType)

</pre><p>Putting all of those steps together, we finally have a way to know which log sessions are running on the machine, which processes notify each of the GUIDs in the session, and which processes are subscribed to them. This can help us understand the purpose of different ETW log sessions running on the machine, such as identifying the log sessions used by EDR software or interesting hardware components. These scripts can also be modified as needed to identify ETW irregularities, such as a log session that has been disabled in order to blind security products. From an attacker perspective, gathering this information can tell us which ETW providers are used on a machine and which ones are ignored and, therefore, don’t present us with any risk of detection.</p><p>Overall, ETW is a very powerful mechanism, so getting more visibility into its internal workings is useful for attackers and defenders alike. This post only scratches the surface, and there’s so much more work that can be done in this area.</p><p>All of the JavaScript functions shown in this post can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/WinDbg-JS/blob/main/EtwKernelRoutines.js" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>.</p></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>
