Tutorial & a blog post that demonstrate how to code a Windows driver to inject a custom DLL into all running processes. I coded it from start to finish using C++ and x86/x64 Assembly language in Microsoft Visual Studio. The solution includes a kernel driver project, a DLL project and a C++ test console project.

# InjectAll

[Permalink: InjectAll](https://github.com/dennisbabkin/InjectAll#injectall)

_Credit: I want to thank [Rbmm](https://dennisbabkin.com/blog/author/?a=rbmm) for providing [his code](https://github.com/rbmm/INJECT) as the basis for this solution._

* * *

This is the source code for my video tutorial that demonstrates how to code a Windows driver to inject a custom DLL into all running processes. I coded it from start to finish using C++ and x86/x64 Assembly language in Microsoft Visual Studio. The solution includes a kernel driver project, a DLL project and a C++ test console project.

What is the purpose of this? There's no purpose. It's just a tutorial to show how to code it.

For more details please [check my blog post](https://dennisbabkin.com/blog/?t=coding-windows-driver-dll-injection-into-all-running-processes-in-visual-studio).
