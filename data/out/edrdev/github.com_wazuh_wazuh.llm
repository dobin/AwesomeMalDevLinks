Title:
Wazuh – Open Source Security Platform (Unified XDR & SIEM)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository contains the core Wazuh platform, an open-source endpoint and workload security solution combining SIEM-style log analytics with XDR-like endpoint telemetry and response.  
- It addresses centralized threat detection, compliance monitoring, and incident response across on-prem, virtualized, containerized, and cloud environments using agents plus a management server.  
- Key capabilities include log collection and rule-based correlation, file integrity monitoring (FIM), vulnerability detection via software inventory + CVE correlation, configuration assessment, and active response actions.  
- The stack integrates with Elastic Stack for indexing/search and dashboards (Wazuh WUI) to investigate alerts and operational/security posture.  
- It’s useful for Blue Teams/SOC, security engineering, and compliance teams; Red Teams can use it to understand common detection logic, telemetry sources, and response actions they may face.  
- It’s notable for being a full-featured, extensible open-source alternative to commercial endpoint monitoring + SIEM pipelines, with broad OS/platform coverage and automation/deployment tooling.

Technical Focus:
- Endpoint agent telemetry collection and secure forwarding
- Rule/signature-based log analysis (regex-driven detection rules)
- File Integrity Monitoring (permissions/ownership/attributes/content changes)
- Vulnerability detection (software inventory + CVE database correlation)
- Configuration assessment / policy compliance checks
- Active response / remote command execution for IR workflows

Use Cases:
- Centralized host and application log collection and correlation
- Detecting malware/rootkits/anomalies and suspicious system behavior
- Monitoring critical files/registries for unauthorized changes (FIM)
- Continuous vulnerability exposure reporting across fleets
- Compliance reporting (e.g., PCI DSS) and hardening validation
- Automating containment actions (e.g., blocking sources) based on alerts
