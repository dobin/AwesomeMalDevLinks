Title:
InjectAll — Coding a Windows Kernel Driver to Inject a DLL into All Running Processes

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
InjectAll is a tutorial-style source repository demonstrating how to build a Windows kernel-mode driver that injects a custom DLL into all running processes. It includes three components: a kernel driver, an injected DLL, and a user-mode C++ test console, implemented with C++ plus x86/x64 assembly in Visual Studio. The project focuses on end-to-end implementation details for system-wide DLL injection from kernel context rather than providing a polished “tool.” It’s primarily useful for red teamers, malware researchers, and Windows internals learners who want to understand kernel-assisted code injection mechanics and the engineering required to deploy it. The accompanying blog post and long-form YouTube playlist provide the step-by-step build and coding walkthrough. It’s interesting because it bridges user-mode injection concepts with kernel driver development and cross-architecture (x86/x64) considerations.

Technical Focus:
- Windows kernel-mode driver development (WDK) and user-mode coordination
- System-wide DLL injection mechanics across processes
- x86/x64 assembly integration in injection stubs/loader logic
- Windows process/thread internals relevant to injection
- Visual Studio build pipeline for mixed driver + user-mode projects

Use Cases:
- Building a lab-grade kernel-assisted DLL injection PoC
- Learning Windows driver development patterns for process manipulation
- Developing/understanding offensive tradecraft around global user-mode instrumentation
- Creating test harnesses for EDR/self-defense research in controlled environments
