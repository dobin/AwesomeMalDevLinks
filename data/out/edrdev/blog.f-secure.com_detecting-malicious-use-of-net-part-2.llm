Title:
Detecting Malicious Use of Net – Part 2

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post continues F-Secure’s analysis of how attackers abuse Windows’ built-in `net.exe`/`net1.exe` commands for reconnaissance and lateral movement in Active Directory environments.  
- It focuses on detection engineering: how to distinguish legitimate administrative usage from attacker “living off the land” activity using command-line patterns, parent/child process context, and execution frequency.  
- The article discusses telemetry sources and practical hunting logic for common `net` operations (e.g., user/group enumeration, domain queries, share/session listing) and how adversaries chain these commands during discovery.  
- It is primarily useful for Blue Teams, threat hunters, and SOC analysts building detections in SIEM/EDR, but also helps red teams understand what `net` usage tends to be high-signal.  
- The key value is translating a ubiquitous Windows admin tool into actionable detection opportunities without relying solely on brittle string matching.

Technical Focus:
- Windows LOLBins (`net.exe`, `net1.exe`) abuse
- Active Directory / domain discovery via `net` commands
- Process creation telemetry and command-line analytics
- Behavioral baselining and anomaly detection for admin tooling
- Detection rule design (hunting queries, alert tuning)

Use Cases:
- Build SIEM/EDR detections for suspicious `net` command execution
- Hunt for AD reconnaissance sequences preceding credential theft or lateral movement
- Reduce false positives by adding context (parent process, user, host role, time patterns)
- Create purple-team test cases to validate monitoring coverage for `net.exe` activity
