Title:
SylantStrike – Simple EDR implementation to demonstrate bypass

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
SylantStrike is a minimal, educational EDR-like implementation created as part of a two-part blog series on building and then bypassing an EDR. The repository provides a reference design for basic endpoint monitoring/detection logic and a companion injector component (SylantStrikeInject) to exercise or evade those detections. It focuses on demonstrating common EDR building blocks and the practical weaknesses attackers can leverage when detections are simplistic or rely on easily-hooked userland telemetry. The codebase (primarily C and C#) is intended for learning and experimentation rather than production defense. It is useful for red teamers and malware researchers studying evasion, and for blue teamers wanting to understand how naive EDR approaches fail. The associated blog post provides the conceptual walkthrough and rationale behind the implementation.

Technical Focus:
- Userland EDR design patterns and telemetry collection
- API hooking / monitoring of suspicious Windows behaviors
- Process injection concepts (via companion injector project)
- Detection logic limitations and bypass strategies
- Windows internals relevant to endpoint monitoring

Use Cases:
- Build a lab-grade “toy EDR” to understand common detection approaches
- Develop and test EDR bypass/evasion techniques against simplistic monitoring
- Teach defenders how attacker tradecraft targets usermode hooks and weak telemetry
- Create proof-of-concept injection activity to validate detection coverage
