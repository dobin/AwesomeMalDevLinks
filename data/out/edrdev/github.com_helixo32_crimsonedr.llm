Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
CrimsonEDR is an open-source Windows DLL + controller panel that simulates common AV/EDR detections to help malware developers and red teamers test evasion techniques in a controlled way. It focuses on identifying behavioral patterns such as direct syscalls, NTDLL unhooking, AMSI/ETW patching, reflective PE loading, PE stomping, and suspicious thread origins/start addresses from unbacked memory. The project also demonstrates user-mode API monitoring by hooking `NtWriteVirtualMemory` to observe memory modifications associated with injection. It supports custom byte-pattern/IOC matching via a JSON file (default patterns include msfvenom-related sequences). Usage involves injecting the CrimsonEDR DLL into a target process using `CrimsonEDRPanel.exe` with a PID and DLL path. It’s useful for red team operators, malware dev training, and defenders who want a lightweight lab tool to understand what common EDR heuristics look for.

Technical Focus:
- Direct syscall detection and syscall-evasion heuristics
- NTDLL unhooking detection
- AMSI patch detection (byte-level integrity checks)
- ETW patch detection (byte-level integrity checks)
- Reflective PE loading / in-memory execution detection
- API hooking of `NtWriteVirtualMemory` and memory-modification monitoring

Use Cases:
- Validate whether a loader/injector triggers common EDR-style heuristics
- Train on AMSI/ETW bypass detection and counter-detection concepts in a lab
- Test reflective loaders, PE stomping, and unbacked thread techniques against simulated telemetry
- Build and iterate custom IOC byte-pattern signatures via `ioc.json`
- Demonstrate user-mode hooking and process injection mechanics for education
