Title:
TelemetrySource

Type:
GitHub Tool (research/dataset)

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- TelemetrySource is a mapping project that links Windows telemetry events back to the specific functions/APIs responsible for generating them.  
- It focuses on understanding how common defensive data sources (Sysmon, Windows Security Auditing events, and Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence ETW) are triggered at the code/API level.  
- The repo provides per-source documentation plus visual overviews, and references a central Google Sheet used as the main event-to-function mapping index.  
- The methodology is documented via a series of blog posts describing how the author traces events “down to APIs.”  
- It’s useful for defenders building higher-fidelity detections and for red teams/malware researchers who want to understand what behaviors generate which logs (and where evasion might be possible).  
- The key value is making telemetry provenance explicit, enabling more informed detection engineering and validation.

Technical Focus:
- Windows event generation provenance (event → API/function mapping)
- Sysmon event triggers and underlying Windows APIs
- Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing event sources
- ETW providers, specifically Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence
- Telemetry research methodology and reverse mapping workflows

Use Cases:
- Validate which Windows APIs/behaviors will trigger specific Sysmon or Security log events
- Build or tune detections based on known event-generation paths
- Identify logging blind spots and potential evasion opportunities for adversary simulation
- Create test cases to reproduce specific telemetry for purple-team exercises
- Improve incident response triage by understanding event origin and prerequisites
