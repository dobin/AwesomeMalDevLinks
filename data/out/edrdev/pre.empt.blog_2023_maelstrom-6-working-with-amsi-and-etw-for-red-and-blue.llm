Title:
Maelstrom #6 – Working with AMSI and ETW for Red and Blue (page missing / 404)

Type:
Blog Post (Unavailable)

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
The provided URL returns a 404, so the original content cannot be retrieved or analyzed from the link alone. Based on the slug, the post likely discussed practical interaction with AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) and ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) from both offensive and defensive perspectives. It probably covered how AMSI is invoked during script/content scanning and how ETW providers emit telemetry used by EDRs, plus common ways attackers attempt to reduce visibility and how defenders can detect those attempts. Without the actual text, specific techniques, code, or defensive guidance cannot be confirmed. If you can provide an archive copy or pasted content, I can produce an accurate technical summary.

Technical Focus:
- AMSI integration and content scanning paths
- ETW providers, sessions, and telemetry consumption
- EDR/AV visibility points in Windows userland
- Detection vs. evasion tradeoffs around instrumentation

Use Cases:
- Assessing where AMSI/ETW provide detection coverage in an engagement
- Building detections around suspicious AMSI/ETW tampering behaviors
- Validating EDR telemetry pipelines using ETW events
- Hardening monitoring for script-based execution and in-memory activity
