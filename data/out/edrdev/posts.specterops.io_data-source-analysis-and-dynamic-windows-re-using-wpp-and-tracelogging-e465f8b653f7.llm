Title:
Data Source Analysis and Dynamic Windows RE Using WPP and TraceLogging

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post covers how to reverse engineer and analyze Windows telemetry/data sources by leveraging Windows software tracing frameworks: WPP (Windows software trace preprocessor) and TraceLogging.  
- It focuses on extracting meaningful event schemas and provider metadata to understand what a component logs, even when symbols or documentation are limited.  
- The techniques emphasize dynamic analysis: enabling providers, capturing ETW traces, and correlating emitted events back to code paths and runtime behavior.  
- It discusses how WPP/TraceLogging instrumentation appears in binaries and how to identify providers, GUIDs, and event fields for building parsers and detections.  
- Useful for red teamers and malware analysts who want to understand what their actions generate in telemetry, and for blue teamers building high-fidelity detections from ETW sources.  
- It’s interesting because it treats ETW not just as a logging mechanism but as a rich reverse-engineering surface for mapping opaque Windows components and security-relevant behaviors.

Technical Focus:
- ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) provider discovery and analysis  
- WPP tracing internals and message formats  
- TraceLogging provider/event metadata and schema extraction  
- Dynamic trace collection and correlation to runtime behavior  
- Reverse engineering telemetry pipelines (providers, GUIDs, event IDs/fields)

Use Cases:
- Identify which Windows components emit security-relevant ETW events for a behavior
- Build custom ETW-based detections or enrich SIEM pipelines with new data sources
- Validate red team tradecraft against host telemetry (what gets logged, where, and how)
- Reverse engineer undocumented Windows features by observing emitted trace events
- Create parsers/decoders for proprietary WPP/TraceLogging event payloads
