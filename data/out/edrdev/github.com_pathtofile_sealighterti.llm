Title:
Sealighter-TI (SealighterTI) — Run Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence ETW Provider via PPL abuse

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
Sealighter-TI is a Windows research tool that combines the Sealighter ETW logging project with PPLDump’s Protected Process Light (PPL) abuse technique to start consuming the `Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence` ETW provider without using a Microsoft-signed driver. The problem it addresses is that subscribing to the Threat-Intelligence provider typically requires an Anti-Malware (or higher) PPL process, which is difficult to obtain legitimately outside of vendor workflows. It leverages an (historically) unpatched technique to coerce a PPL `services.exe` instance into loading an arbitrary DLL, then uses that privileged context to run the ETW trace and forward events into the Windows Event Log under a custom “Sealighter/Operational” channel. The repo includes build/run instructions using `wevtutil` to install an ETW manifest and emphasizes Release builds for reliable injection. It’s useful for defenders and security researchers who want high-fidelity injection/attack telemetry, and for red teamers who want to understand/validate PPL boundaries and ETW-based detections. Note: the underlying PPLDump exploit path is documented as patched on newer Windows 10 builds (21H2 19044.1826+), with alternatives suggested (e.g., vulnerable drivers).

Technical Focus:
- ETW subscription to `Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence`
- Protected Process Light (PPL) / Anti-Malware protection level
- PPL abuse via DLL loading into PPL `services.exe` (PPLDump technique)
- Event forwarding into Windows Event Log via custom provider manifest (`wevtutil im`)
- Windows injection/Detours-style hooking and DLL-based payload execution

Use Cases:
- Collect Threat-Intelligence ETW telemetry on systems where you can’t deploy a signed kernel driver
- Validate/benchmark detections for process injection using TI ETW events
- Research PPL trust boundaries and historical code-integrity/PPL bypass techniques
- Lab reproduction of PPLDump-style primitives with an ETW logging payload instead of LSASS dumping
- Generate Windows Event Log artifacts for SIEM ingestion and detection engineering
