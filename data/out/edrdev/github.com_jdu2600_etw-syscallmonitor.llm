Title:
Etw-SyscallMonitor — Hunting hidden shellcode via syscall summaries

GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
Etw-SyscallMonitor is a C# proof-of-concept that uses kernel ETW telemetry to build per-process “syscall summaries” (a set of security-relevant syscalls and selected parameters) as a runtime analogue to static import/capability profiling. The goal is to detect hidden shellcode or injected code by spotting anomalous syscall sets for a process, even when user-mode anti-analysis techniques are used. It periodically writes a whole-system `SyscallSummary.json` plus per-process profiles keyed by executable and a startup hash. The approach emphasizes robustness (malware must invoke syscalls to do work) but trades off event-level granularity, so it’s better for behavioral fingerprinting than precise timelines. The repo notes it works best on Windows 10 and uses BYOVD to enable PPL in order to collect `Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence` ETW events. It’s useful for threat hunters/blue teams building detections and for red teams/malware researchers evaluating syscall-level footprints and detection surfaces.

Technical Focus:
- Windows ETW collection (kernel + Threat Intelligence provider)
- Syscall set/profiling per process (behavioral fingerprinting)
- Detection of injected/hidden shellcode via syscall anomalies
- PPL enablement and telemetry access (BYOVD-assisted)
- Periodic JSON export of system and per-process summaries

Use Cases:
- Hunt for process injection/shellcode by comparing syscall profiles against baselines
- Build lightweight behavioral fingerprints for executables without full tracing
- Validate whether evasive payloads still expose distinctive syscall patterns
- Generate artifacts (`SyscallSummary.json`, per-process JSON) for offline analysis/correlation
