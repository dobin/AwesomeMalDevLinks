Title:
Sanctum EDR (Rust Kernel Driver EDR PoC)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Sanctum is an experimental proof-of-concept Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) stack for Windows 11, implemented primarily in Rust with a kernel driver plus user-mode components.  
- It focuses on detecting “modern malware techniques” beyond traditional AV by monitoring low-level behavior such as syscall activity, NTDLL tampering, and kernel/rootkit manipulation.  
- The project explores kernel-side syscall interception via “Alt Syscalls,” ETW Threat Intelligence telemetry (partially deprecated/transitioning), and “Ghost Hunting” style detection for suspicious API/syscall patterns.  
- It includes supporting infrastructure like a GUI (Tauri), a user-mode engine that communicates with the driver, and legacy process-wide DLL injection/hooking components (now largely replaced by kernel hooking).  
- Deployment is intentionally VM-only due to kernel tampering risk and involves driver build/signing, optional ELAM/PPL service components, and specific file placement (e.g., sanctum.dll in System32).  
- Useful for defensive engineers, malware analysts, and red teamers researching EDR internals, Windows kernel telemetry, and how detection can be implemented (and potentially evaded).  

Technical Focus:
- Windows kernel driver EDR architecture (Rust, windows-drivers-rs toolchain)
- Kernel-side syscall interception (“Alt Syscalls”) and its constraints under HVCI/VBS
- ETW Threat Intelligence provider consumption (legacy/deprecated path)
- Detection of NTDLL/user-mode tampering and syscall-hook evasion signals (“Ghost Hunting”)
- File-system minifilter for ransomware-style file write detection
- Protected Process Light (PPL) / ELAM-related service deployment and signing workflow

Use Cases:
- Build a lab EDR to study Windows 11 kernel telemetry and detection engineering
- Research syscall interception approaches and their interaction with HVCI/PatchGuard/HyperGuard
- Prototype detections for injection, NTDLL patching, and rootkit-style kernel tampering
- Develop and test ransomware-like file activity detection via minifilter signals
- Red team validation of EDR detection surfaces and potential bypass strategies (in a VM)
