Title:
Windows 10 ETW Events

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository is a curated dataset of Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) event metadata collected from all manifest-based and MOF-based ETW providers across multiple Windows 10 releases (and includes Windows 11 21H2 updates).  
- It addresses the practical problem of enumerating and tracking ETW provider/event coverage and changes between OS versions, which is otherwise scattered across manifests, MOF classes, and undocumented/unknown providers.  
- The repo organizes provider definitions into `manifest/`, `mof/`, and `unknown/` categories and provides counts per Windows version (events and provider totals), enabling version-to-version diffing and telemetry planning.  
- It’s useful for Blue Teams building detections from ETW, Red Teams assessing telemetry exposure and potential ETW-based monitoring, and researchers doing Windows internals/telemetry analysis.  
- It’s interesting because it provides broad, versioned visibility into ETW’s available event surface area, which is foundational for both detection engineering and understanding what security products can observe.

Technical Focus:
- ETW provider enumeration (manifest-based vs MOF-based)
- Event metadata extraction and cataloging across Windows versions
- Provider/event surface comparison (version diffs)
- Windows telemetry and instrumentation (WPP/TraceLogging context via references)
- ETW tooling ecosystem (PerfView, KrabsETW, SilkETW references)

Use Cases:
- Build/validate ETW-based detection logic and data dictionaries
- Identify which ETW providers/events exist on specific Windows 10 builds
- Compare telemetry changes across Windows versions for regression testing
- Support threat hunting by mapping suspicious behaviors to ETW event sources
- Red team recon on likely host telemetry sources used by EDR/SIEM pipelines
