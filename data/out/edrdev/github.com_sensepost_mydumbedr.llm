Title:
MyDumbEDR

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- MyDumbEDR is a deliberately “buggy” educational EDR-like lab environment meant to be bypassed.  
- The repository provides multiple components (user-mode DLL, kernel driver, remote injector, static analyzer, and a shellcode injector) to simulate common EDR building blocks and mistakes.  
- The goal is to study the source, identify implementation flaws, and develop bypasses similar to what might work against real-world endpoint products.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers, pentesters, and security researchers practicing evasion, as well as blue teamers learning how EDR telemetry and hooks can fail.  
- It’s interesting because it offers a controlled, reproducible target for experimenting with injection, monitoring, and bypass techniques without needing a commercial EDR.

Technical Focus:
- Windows user-mode monitoring via DLLs (hooking/instrumentation concepts)
- Kernel driver components and kernel/user interaction
- Remote process injection and shellcode execution
- Static analysis / detection logic simulation
- EDR bypass methodology through intentional implementation flaws

Use Cases:
- Practice developing and testing EDR evasion/bypass techniques in a safe lab
- Learn how EDR components (driver + userland) are commonly structured
- Build detections by understanding typical bypass primitives and failure modes
- Training material for internal red team / blue team workshops
- Rapid prototyping of injection and telemetry-interference techniques
