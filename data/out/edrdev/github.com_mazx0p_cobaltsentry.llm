Cobalt Sentry (CobaltSentry)

GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
CobaltSentry is a Windows process memory scanner written in Go aimed at detecting Cobalt Strike beacons and related stealth techniques in live processes. It targets common in-memory tradecraft such as SleepMask (high-entropy regions), XOR-masked payloads/configs, Userland Reflective Loader (UDRL) artifacts, and API redirection/proxying patterns associated with “BeaconGate.” It also attempts to identify syscall evasion patterns like Hell’s Gate and Heaven’s Gate. The tool can scan all processes or a specific PID and supports multi-threaded scanning for speed, requiring admin rights to read process memory. It’s primarily useful for Blue Teams/DFIR and threat hunters validating beacon presence, but also valuable for red teams to test OPSEC and measure detectability of in-memory implants.

Technical Focus:
- Windows process memory enumeration and scanning
- Cobalt Strike beacon artifact detection (SleepMask, config patterns)
- Entropy-based detection of encrypted/masked regions
- XOR decoding / masked payload identification
- UDRL / reflective loading indicators (PE header anomalies)
- Syscall evasion detection (Hell’s Gate / Heaven’s Gate) and API redirection

Use Cases:
- Hunt for Cobalt Strike beacons across endpoints by scanning running processes
- Triage a suspicious PID to identify in-memory loader/beacon artifacts
- Validate whether SleepMask/XOR masking is leaving detectable memory patterns
- Detect potential syscall-stomping/gating techniques used to evade EDR telemetry
- Support incident response by quickly flagging likely beacon-infected processes
