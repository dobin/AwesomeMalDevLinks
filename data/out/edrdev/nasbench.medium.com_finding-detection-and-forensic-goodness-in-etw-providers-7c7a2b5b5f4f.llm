Title:
Finding Detection and Forensic Goodness In ETW Providers

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post surveys lesser-used Windows Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) providers that can generate high-value telemetry for detection engineering and forensics.  
- It focuses on identifying specific providers, channels (Operational/Analytic/Debug/Diagnostic/Tracing), and event IDs that reveal process, thread, image-load, file, network, registry, authentication, and remote-access activity.  
- Examples include Kernel-Process (process/thread/image events), Kernel-File (create/delete), Kernel-Network (connect and byte counts), Kernel-Registry (key/value operations), LDAP-Client (LDAP search queries), COMRuntime (COM interface/method calls), TerminalServices client events (RDP initiation), and RPC call tracing.  
- The article highlights how these sources can complement or substitute more common logs (e.g., Sysmon/Security) when building detections or reconstructing attacker behavior.  
- It’s primarily useful for Blue Teams/detection engineers and DFIR, but also valuable for Red Teams to understand what native telemetry may expose their tradecraft.  
- Collection examples are shown using the Python `pywintrace` library, with scripts/resources referenced in a companion GitHub repo.

Technical Focus:
- ETW providers, channels, and event IDs (Analytic/Debug/Diagnostic/Tracing)
- Kernel telemetry: process/thread/image load, file I/O, network connections, registry operations
- LDAP client query tracing via `wldap32.dll`
- COM/DCOM activity visibility via COMRuntime events
- RDP client initiation telemetry (TerminalServices client providers)
- RPC client/server call tracing

Use Cases:
- Build Sigma/SIEM detections from ETW sources beyond standard Windows logs
- Forensic timeline reconstruction (process → module loads → file/registry changes → network)
- Detect LDAP reconnaissance by capturing LDAP search filters/queries
- Identify potential DCOM lateral movement via COM interface/method call traces
- Monitor RDP client usage from endpoints (mstsc.exe initiation events)
- Validate what native Windows telemetry reveals about offensive tooling behavior
