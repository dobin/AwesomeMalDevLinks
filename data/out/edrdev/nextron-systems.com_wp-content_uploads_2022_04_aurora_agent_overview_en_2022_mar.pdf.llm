Title:
Aurora Agent Overview (Nextron Systems) — Custom Sigma-based EDR

Type:
Documentation

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This document describes Nextron’s Aurora Agent, a lightweight Windows endpoint agent that performs real-time Sigma rule matching locally on endpoints using ETW (Event Tracing for Windows).  
- It aims to provide “custom EDR” capabilities with lower log volume and reduced backend/network/storage requirements by only forwarding matches rather than full telemetry streams.  
- The agent recreates most Sysmon-like events from ETW (claimed ~95% Sigma coverage) and extends Sigma with response actions (e.g., kill process/parent, suspend, process memory dump, custom commands).  
- It includes resource controls (CPU/output throttling), multiple output options (Event Log, file, TCP/UDP, JSON), and supports local config management or centralized management via ASGARD.  
- Additional features include IOC matching (hashes, filenames, pipes, C2 indicators), enrichment fields (e.g., ProcessTree, FileAge), and statistics reporting to detect tampering or ETW disruption.  
- Useful for defenders/blue teams and detection engineers who want transparent, rule-driven endpoint detection/response without deploying Sysmon drivers; also relevant to red teams for understanding ETW/Sigma-based detection and response behaviors.

Technical Focus:
- ETW-based endpoint telemetry collection (Sysmon-like event recreation)
- Sigma rule execution on endpoints (local matching)
- Automated response actions (kill/suspend/dump/custom commands)
- IOC matching across multiple event types (hash/IP/FQDN/filename patterns)
- Resource throttling and output pipelines (Eventlog/file/TCP/UDP/JSON)
- Centralized rule/response management via ASGARD + update mechanisms

Use Cases:
- Deploying a Sigma-driven endpoint detection stack with minimal telemetry egress
- Rapid containment actions for high-confidence detections (e.g., ransomware response sets)
- Custom detection engineering using Sigma plus Aurora-specific enrichment fields
- Monitoring for sensor tampering via event-rate/statistics reporting
- Forwarding only alerts/matches into SIEM/MDR pipelines instead of raw logs
