Title:
EVTX/ETW Resources (EVTX-ETW-Resources)

Type:
GitHub Tool (Resource Repository / Dataset)

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository curates datasets and references to help practitioners learn and operationalize Windows Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) and EVTX logging.  
- It provides large collections of ETW provider manifests (raw XML) per Windows version, plus generated CSVs enumerating providers, event IDs, and message templates (split into internal vs third-party providers).  
- It also includes per-OS “all events” CSVs that aggregate event metadata across providers, enabling fast searching and mapping of telemetry to behaviors.  
- The repo links to key ETW research, talks, and tooling for interacting with ETW (e.g., logman, TraceEvent, PerfView, SilkETW) and includes example scripts (e.g., pywintrace).  
- Useful for Blue Teams and DFIR to build detections and understand telemetry coverage, and for Red Teams/researchers to assess what actions generate which ETW signals and where sensors may exist.  
- Interesting because it turns ETW’s fragmented provider ecosystem into searchable, versioned artifacts that can be used for engineering detections and telemetry-driven research.

Technical Focus:
- ETW provider manifests (instrumentation XML) and event schema extraction  
- EVTX/ETW event ID and message cataloging across Windows versions  
- Provider inventorying (Windows-native vs third-party, e.g., Sysmon/AV/Office)  
- ETW collection/consumption tooling (logman, TraceEvent, PerfView, SilkETW, KrabsETW)  
- Telemetry research for detection/forensics and ETW sensor tampering awareness

Use Cases:
- Build/validate detection logic by mapping behaviors to ETW providers and event IDs
- Identify high-value ETW providers for threat hunting and forensic triage
- Compare ETW telemetry changes across Windows versions (e.g., Windows 10 vs 11)
- Generate allowlists/blocklists or coverage matrices for EDR/ETW-based sensors
- Rapidly search event metadata when reverse engineering suspicious activity or tooling
