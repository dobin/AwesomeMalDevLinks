Title:
Windows APIs To Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence events (TelemetrySource)

Type:
GitHub Tool / Documentation

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository section documents and maps Windows API/NT operations to ETW events emitted by the `Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence` provider.  
- It focuses on identifying which user-mode and kernel-mode actions trigger specific Threat Intelligence telemetry, especially around process injection primitives and memory manipulation.  
- Covered event types include remote/local virtual memory allocation/protection/mapping, cross-process read/write, APC queuing, thread context changes, process/thread suspend/resume/freeze/thaw, and driver/device object load/unload.  
- The author frames the mapping in terms of “operational functions” that perform the action, undocumented “event processing functions” that initiate auditing, and the final emission via `nt!EtwWrite`.  
- Useful for red teams and malware researchers to understand what behaviors are likely to generate TI ETW signals, and for blue teams to build detections tied to concrete API call patterns.  
- Includes a public Google Sheet intended as a living mapping reference.

Technical Focus:
- ETW provider `Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence` event taxonomy
- API-to-telemetry mapping for injection/memory-tampering primitives
- Undocumented event processing/auditing functions in Windows
- `nt!EtwWrite` event emission path
- Kernel-caller vs user-mode caller distinctions for TI events
- Driver/device object load/unload telemetry

Use Cases:
- Build or validate detections for process injection and memory tampering based on TI ETW events
- Assess which injection techniques are most likely to trigger Threat Intelligence telemetry
- Correlate suspicious API sequences (e.g., alloc/protect/write + APC/context) to specific TI event IDs
- Research Windows internal auditing hooks and ETW emission paths
- Create lab tests to reproduce and baseline TI provider events across Windows versions
