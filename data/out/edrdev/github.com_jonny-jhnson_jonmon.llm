Title:
JonMon v2.0

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- JonMon is a Windows telemetry research project that implements multiple open-source “sensors” to capture system activity for testing and verification.  
- It combines a kernel-mode driver (for low-level events like process creation, registry operations, and file create activity) with user-mode collection (covering .NET, RPC, network activity, and other events).  
- Collected telemetry is surfaced through the Windows Event Log to make querying and analysis straightforward.  
- The project is explicitly positioned as non-production research code intended to help understand and validate telemetry mechanisms (similar to how EDRs gather signals).  
- It’s useful for defenders and detection engineers validating event coverage, and for red teamers/pentesters who want to understand what actions generate which telemetry.  
- The repo includes configuration (JSON) and a wiki with installation guidance and event mapping.

Technical Focus:
- Windows kernel driver telemetry collection (minifilter-style file/registry/process monitoring)
- User-mode instrumentation for .NET, RPC, and network events
- Windows Event Log as a telemetry output pipeline
- Telemetry validation / event-to-activity mapping
- Config-driven sensor behavior (JSON configuration)

Use Cases:
- Build a lab telemetry sensor to understand what Windows actions generate which events
- Validate detection logic by generating and observing ground-truth event streams
- Compare kernel vs user-mode visibility gaps for specific attacker behaviors
- Prototype custom telemetry sources before implementing production-grade sensors
- Create event mappings for threat hunting and detection engineering
