Title:
SilkETW: Because Free Telemetry is … Free!

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post introduces SilkETW, a Mandiant/FireEye research tool that simplifies collecting and analyzing Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) telemetry.  
- It addresses two common ETW adoption blockers: collection complexity and overwhelming event volume, by providing a straightforward CLI, filtering, and normalized JSON output.  
- The article shows how to capture kernel and user-mode ETW providers (e.g., process/image load and .NET runtime events) and then triage results with PowerShell.  
- A key feature is YARA integration to tag/filter ETW events, enabling detection or research workflows such as identifying in-memory .NET tradecraft (e.g., execute-assembly) via runtime strings/metadata.  
- It’s useful to both Blue Teams (telemetry-driven detections, hunting) and Red Teams/researchers (understanding what ETW exposes, testing evasion, reverse engineering and tradecraft analysis).  
- The post is interesting because it operationalizes “free” Windows-native telemetry into a portable, scriptable format that can feed local analysis or pipelines like Elasticsearch.

Technical Focus:
- Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) providers (Kernel, Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime)
- ETW event filtering (by event name, PID/process name, opcode, keywords)
- JSON normalization/serialization of ETW events for downstream processing
- PowerShell-based triage and analytics of ETW output
- YARA scanning/tagging applied to ETW event content
- .NET runtime telemetry (JIT/Loader/Interop/NGen keywords) for tradecraft visibility

Use Cases:
- Rapid collection of kernel process/image-load telemetry to spot suspicious tooling execution
- Hunting for in-memory .NET activity (e.g., execute-assembly) using DotNETRuntime ETW events
- Building/validating detection logic from ETW data and exporting to SIEM/Elasticsearch
- Reverse engineering and behavioral analysis using high-fidelity Windows internals telemetry
- Red team testing of defensive visibility and potential ETW-based detection coverage
