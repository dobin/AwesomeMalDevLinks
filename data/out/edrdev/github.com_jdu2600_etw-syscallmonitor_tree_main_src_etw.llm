Title:
Etw-SyscallMonitor (ETW source module)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository contains C# code for consuming Windows Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) providers to monitor low-level system activity, with an emphasis on syscall/API-relevant telemetry.  
- The `src/ETW` module implements user-mode ETW trace session management (`EtwUserTrace*`) and strongly-typed provider/event definitions for multiple Windows providers (Kernel-Process, Kernel-File, Kernel-Network, Kernel-Registry, Security-Auditing, WFP, Win32k, Threat-Intelligence, etc.).  
- It solves the problem of reliably collecting and parsing high-fidelity Windows telemetry without relying on EDR-specific sensors, enabling correlation of process, file, registry, and network behaviors.  
- The code is useful for red teams and security researchers building syscall visibility tooling, and for blue teams prototyping detections or validating what ETW can observe.  
- It’s interesting because it centralizes many high-value ETW providers and provides a reusable tracing abstraction that can be adapted for monitoring, hunting, or evaluating evasion techniques.

Technical Focus:
- Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) consumer implementation in C#
- User-mode trace sessions and provider subscription
- Windows Kernel ETW providers (process/file/network/registry)
- Security-Auditing and Threat-Intelligence ETW telemetry
- Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) event collection
- Win32k/UI subsystem event tracing

Use Cases:
- Build a syscall-/API-adjacent activity monitor using ETW instead of hooks
- Collect process/file/registry/network timelines for incident response or hunts
- Validate which behaviors generate ETW events during payload execution
- Prototype detection logic based on Kernel/WFP/Security-Auditing ETW streams
- Research and test ETW evasion/visibility gaps across providers
