About Event Tracing (Event Tracing for Windows / ETW)

Type:
Documentation

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This Microsoft documentation explains Event Tracing for Windows (ETW), a high-performance kernel-level telemetry system for logging OS and application events to files or real-time consumers.  
- It breaks ETW into its core roles: controllers (manage trace sessions and buffers), providers (emit events when enabled), and consumers (read/process events from sessions or logs).  
- The page outlines provider implementation models—MOF/classic, WPP, manifest-based, and TraceLogging—and the primary APIs used to register and write events (e.g., EventRegister/EventWrite vs. legacy TraceEvent).  
- It highlights operational characteristics important for production tracing, such as dynamic enable/disable without restarts and multi-session support limits (notably up to eight sessions for manifest/TraceLogging providers).  
- It also covers common causes of missing/lost events (oversized events, buffer sizing, slow consumers, disk throughput), which impacts reliability of telemetry pipelines.  
- Useful for defenders building telemetry/detections and for red teams/malware researchers who need to understand ETW-based visibility and its constraints.

Technical Focus:
- ETW architecture: controllers, providers, consumers
- ETW sessions, buffering, real-time vs file logging
- Provider types: MOF (classic), WPP, manifest-based, TraceLogging
- Event emission APIs: RegisterTraceGuids/TraceEvent, EventRegister/EventWrite/EventWriteEx, TraceLoggingRegister/TraceLoggingWrite
- Event loss conditions and performance limits (64K event size, buffer pool, consumer lag)

Use Cases:
- Build or tune Windows telemetry collection pipelines (real-time or file-based ETW)
- Implement custom ETW providers for application diagnostics/performance tracing
- Develop ETW consumers for hunting, detection engineering, or incident response tooling
- Troubleshoot missing events by adjusting session/buffer/disk/consumer performance
- Assess ETW visibility and limitations when modeling attacker activity on Windows
