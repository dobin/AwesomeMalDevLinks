Title:
Best EDR Of The Market (BEOTM) V3

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- BEOTM is an open-source Windows EDR “lab” that implements common endpoint detection techniques to help understand how commercial EDRs work and how attackers try to bypass them.  
- Version 3 focuses on kernel-mode telemetry and interception, providing a driver (`beotm.sys`) plus a userland controller (`beotm.exe`) that also loads and compiles YARA rules (via a vendored Elastic protection-artifacts ruleset).  
- It demonstrates detection approaches such as kernel callbacks for process/thread/image/registry/object events, syscall interception via alternative syscall handlers, VAD-based image integrity checks, and call stack integrity validation (including Shadow Stack usage).  
- The project maps these detections to real-world TTPs like PPID spoofing, credential dumping, process hollowing/ghosting/tampering, APC/thread-hijack injection, abnormal syscalls, and registry persistence.  
- It’s primarily useful for EDR engineers, defenders, malware analysts, and red teamers who want a controlled environment to study detection surfaces and evasion constraints at low level.  
- Notable operational detail: it requires a test VM with Windows in TESTSIGNING mode and is built with VS2022 + WDK (C++20).

Technical Focus:
- Windows kernel driver development (WDK) for EDR-style telemetry
- Kernel callbacks (PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx, PsSetCreateThreadNotifyRoutine, PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine, ObRegisterCallbacks, CmRegisterCallbackEx)
- System call interception via alternative system call handlers + syscall integrity checking
- VAD tree inspection for image/in-memory integrity validation
- Thread call stack integrity checks (including Shadow Stack)
- YARA-based scanning of memory buffers/files (Elastic protection-artifacts rules)

Use Cases:
- Build and test kernel-mode detections for common Windows attack techniques
- Validate how specific injection/persistence TTPs appear in kernel telemetry
- Experiment with syscall monitoring/interception and integrity verification concepts
- Develop and tune YARA rules against in-memory/file artifacts in a lab EDR pipeline
- Reproduce and debug false positives/BSODs in a controlled VM with WinDbg
