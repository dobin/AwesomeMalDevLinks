Title:
Creating a Windows Driver in Rust (Sanctum EDR series)

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post walks through creating a basic Windows kernel-mode driver using Rust as part of the author’s “Sanctum EDR” project series.  
- It focuses on the practical setup needed to get a Rust driver building and loading on Windows, bridging Rust tooling with the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) ecosystem.  
- The content is oriented around kernel driver fundamentals (driver entry/initialization, build/signing considerations, and the scaffolding required before implementing security features).  
- It’s useful for security engineers and researchers building kernel components (EDR/monitoring) as well as offensive developers exploring kernel development in Rust.  
- It’s interesting because Rust in the Windows kernel is still relatively niche, and the post provides a concrete starting point for kernel development workflows that are typically C/C++-centric.

Technical Focus:
- Rust-for-Windows kernel driver development workflow
- Windows Driver Kit (WDK) integration and build pipeline
- Kernel-mode driver initialization (DriverEntry scaffolding)
- Driver loading/signing/test environment considerations
- Foundations for EDR-style kernel components

Use Cases:
- Building a minimal Rust kernel driver skeleton for further development
- Prototyping kernel telemetry/monitoring components for an EDR project
- Setting up a reproducible Rust+WDK toolchain for driver research
- Creating a base driver project to extend with callbacks/hooks/minifilters later
