Title:
Theory: EDR Syscall hooking and Ghost Hunting, my approach to detection

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post outlines a detection strategy for a Windows EDR based on syscall hooking, framed as part of the author’s “Sanctum EDR” project.  
- It focuses on monitoring sensitive system calls (e.g., process access, remote memory allocation) to catch common post-exploitation and malware behaviors at the point they cross into the kernel.  
- The “Ghost Hunting” concept is presented as an approach to identify suspicious or spoofed activity around these syscall events (e.g., mismatches between expected call context and observed behavior), aiming to make user-mode evasion harder.  
- It’s primarily useful for EDR/defensive engineers and Windows internals researchers, but also valuable to red teamers for understanding what syscall-level telemetry and integrity checks can reveal.  
- The interesting angle is treating syscall interception plus contextual validation as a core detection primitive, rather than relying only on higher-level API hooks or signature-based logic.

Technical Focus:
- Windows syscall hooking concepts (user-mode vs kernel-mode visibility)
- Detection of process injection primitives via syscall telemetry (e.g., OpenProcess/VirtualAllocEx patterns)
- Call-context validation / integrity checking (“Ghost Hunting” concept)
- EDR architecture considerations for Windows internals
- Evasion-resistance tradeoffs (API hooks vs syscall-level monitoring)

Use Cases:
- Build an EDR detection pipeline around high-signal syscalls used in injection and credential theft
- Design heuristics to detect spoofed/broadcasted events or misleading call contexts
- Threat-hunt for suspicious process access and remote memory manipulation activity
- Model attacker evasion paths (direct syscalls, unhooking, alternate syscalls) to harden detections
