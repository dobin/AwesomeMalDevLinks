Title:
Sysmon: a viable alternative to EDR?

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post argues that using Sysmon telemetry plus SIEM detection rules is not a viable substitute for a modern EDR in large enterprise environments.  
- The core problem is that raw endpoint telemetry (Sysmon events) has little detection value until it is continuously engineered into high-quality detections, which is costly to build, scale, and maintain.  
- It contrasts “logs vs alerts,” emphasizing that EDRs ship with curated, continuously updated detection logic and response capabilities that internal teams cannot match in throughput.  
- The author highlights operational burdens: deploying Sysmon is easy, but keeping a healthy fleet, tuning configs, and maintaining SIEM rules at scale consumes scarce engineering time.  
- Counterarguments are addressed: Sysmon as “complementary” still adds agent/maintenance overhead, and EDR “black box” detections can be mitigated by using EDR custom detections and SIEM analytics on top of EDR alerts/selected telemetry.  
- Useful primarily for detection engineering leaders, SecOps architects, and blue teams making build-vs-buy decisions for endpoint detection strategy.

Technical Focus:
- Sysmon telemetry vs EDR alerting/detection signals
- Detection engineering at scale (rule lifecycle, tuning, maintenance)
- Enterprise deployment/operations overhead (agent health, rollout, updates)
- SIEM analytics vs endpoint-native detections
- Custom detections in EDR platforms (vendor-specific rule authoring)
- Detection coverage/throughput comparison (internal team vs vendor R&D)

Use Cases:
- Deciding whether to invest in Sysmon-based detection pipelines vs purchasing/deploying EDR
- Designing a monitoring strategy that prioritizes EDR alerts ingestion into SIEM
- Identifying when to use EDR custom detections for org-specific gaps (e.g., legitimate remote tools)
- Planning staffing/time allocation for detection engineering and telemetry operations
- Building governance around “selective telemetry enablement” to support targeted SIEM detections
