Title:
Best EDR Of The Market (BEOTM)

Type:
GitHub Tool / Technical Write-up

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- BEOTM is an open-source, user-mode “toy EDR” intended as a lab for understanding and bypassing common EDR-style detection mechanisms on Windows.  
- It focuses on dynamic process inspection by intercepting sensitive behaviors (memory allocation/protection changes, process/thread manipulation) and observing execution state (RIP and call stacks).  
- The project implements multiple interception approaches: injected-DLL API hooking (via Microsoft Detours) at NTDLL and Kernel32/Kernelbase layers, Import Address Table (IAT) hooking, and continuous thread RIP/call-stack monitoring with argument inspection.  
- Detection decisions can be driven by configurable “trigger” functions and byte-pattern matching rules (YaroRules.json) to flag shellcode-like artifacts (e.g., PEB/LDR-walking patterns common in payloads).  
- It also includes an intentionally unrealistic “SSN crushing” concept that corrupts syscall numbers to force attackers to practice restoring/deriving correct SSNs.  
- Useful for red teamers, malware devs, and defenders learning Windows user-mode telemetry limits, hook bypass strategies, and tradeoffs between coverage and performance.

Technical Focus:
- User-mode DLL injection and API hooking (NTDLL vs Kernel32/Kernelbase)
- Microsoft Detours trampolines and call redirection
- Import Address Table (IAT) patching/hooking
- Thread RIP monitoring, stack unwinding, and argument inspection
- Pattern-based detection using YARA-like byte signatures (JSON rules)
- Syscall/SSN integrity tampering concepts

Use Cases:
- Build a controlled environment to test hook-evasion and unhooking techniques
- Compare detection visibility at NT-layer vs Win32 API-layer interception
- Experiment with call-stack-based detection of shellcode loaders and reflective injection
- Develop and tune byte-pattern rules for payload/artifact identification
- Teach/learn Windows internals around calling conventions, stack args, and API forwarding
