Title:
DriverJack — Hijacking valid driver services to load arbitrary (signed) drivers via NT paths, symbolic links, and emulated filesystem tricks

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- DriverJack is a Windows offensive tool/PoC that loads a (typically vulnerable) kernel driver without registering a new driver service, by hijacking an existing service’s driver image path resolution.  
- It focuses on abusing NT object manager paths, native symbolic links, reparse points, and mount-point manipulation to redirect where the Service Control Manager/driver loader actually reads the driver from.  
- A key component is an “emulated filesystem read-only bypass” that overwrites driver contents on a mounted ISO (CDFS) by remapping pages to writable, enabling stealthy swapping right before load.  
- The project also aims to spoof/masquerade the image path shown in driver load telemetry, and in some variants can evade Sysmon-style path-based detections.  
- Useful for red teams, pentesters, and security researchers studying BYOVD-style driver loading, persistence, and telemetry evasion; also relevant to blue teams for understanding detection gaps around NT path normalization and device symlink tampering.

Technical Focus:
- NT Object Manager symbolic links (e.g., `\Device\BootDevice`) and NT path normalization
- Reparse points and filesystem redirection to `System32\drivers`
- DOS device/global symlink abuse (`\??`, DosDevices)
- Mount point / drive letter swapping (BootPartition manipulation)
- CDFS/ISO “read-only” bypass via page remapping (IoCdfsLib)
- Driver loading via service restart and `NtLoadDriver` behavior

Use Cases:
- Load a vulnerable signed driver (BYOVD) without creating a new driver service entry
- Masquerade driver load paths in telemetry to hinder path-based detections
- Research and validate detection logic around NT paths, device symlinks, and reparse points
- Prototype persistence/stealth techniques involving service-driver hijacking
- Blue-team testing: build detections for `\Device\BootDevice` tampering, mount swaps, and ISO-based driver staging
