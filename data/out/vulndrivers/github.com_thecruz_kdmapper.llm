GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- KDMapper is a Windows kernel driver mapper that abuses Intel’s vulnerable signed driver `iqvw64e.sys` to gain kernel read/write primitives and manually map unsigned drivers into kernel memory.  
- It solves the problem of loading non-signed kernel drivers without using the normal Windows driver loading path, which is typically blocked by Driver Signature Enforcement and modern security controls.  
- The project implements manual PE mapping in kernel space and includes multiple anti-forensics/trace-reduction steps (e.g., clearing `MmUnloadedDrivers`, `PiDDBCacheTable`, and `g_KernelHashBucketList`).  
- It uses a system-call hook (notably `NtAddAtom`) and prefers `NtLoadDriver`/`NtUnloadDriver` to reduce artifacts compared to more direct approaches.  
- It includes tooling to keep offsets compatible across Windows versions via PDB parsing (`SymbolsFromPDB`) and an offsets file workflow to handle frequent kernel structure changes.  
- Useful for red teamers, exploit developers, and kernel researchers; also relevant to blue teams for understanding and detecting BYOVD-based kernel access and manual-mapping tradecraft.

Technical Focus:
- BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) via `iqvw64e.sys`
- Manual mapping of kernel-mode PE drivers (unsigned driver injection)
- Kernel artifact cleanup: `PiDDBCacheTable`, `MmUnloadedDrivers`, `g_KernelHashBucketList`, WDF runtime lists
- Syscall/NTAPI hooking (`NtAddAtom`) and driver load/unload via `NtLoadDriver`/`NtUnloadDriver`
- Windows build compatibility via PDB-based offset resolution (SymbolsFromPDB, offsets.ini)
- PatchGuard/operational constraints for DriverEntry execution

Use Cases:
- Load and execute an unsigned kernel driver for post-exploitation or research
- Kernel R/W primitive usage for security testing (EDR/AC resistance evaluation)
- Studying and reproducing manual-map techniques and kernel trace evasion
- Building detections for vulnerable-driver abuse and kernel artifact tampering
- Rapidly adapting kernel tooling to new Windows builds using PDB-derived offsets
