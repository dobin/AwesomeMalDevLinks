Title:
SilentLoad (“Service-less” driver loading)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- SilentLoad is a Windows C++ utility that loads a kernel driver via `NtLoadDriver` without using the Service Control Manager (SCM) APIs.  
- It directly creates/sets the required service registry key for the driver and then invokes `NtLoadDriver`, aiming to avoid alerts triggered by traditional service creation/start events.  
- The project is positioned for BYOVD-style engagements where operators already have a signed/vulnerable driver and want a quieter load path.  
- It does not handle dropping the `.sys` file; the operator must place the driver on disk and configure the service name and NT path in the source.  
- Useful primarily for red teams and pentesters doing kernel-driver tradecraft; also relevant to blue teams for understanding/detecting non-SCM driver load patterns.

Technical Focus:
- `NtLoadDriver` native API usage
- Direct manipulation of Services registry keys for driver loading
- “Service-less” driver load tradecraft (bypassing SCM workflows)
- BYOVD operational workflow considerations
- NT object manager pathing for drivers (e.g., `\??\C:\Windows\System32\drivers\...`)

Use Cases:
- Load a driver without calling `CreateService`/`StartService` to reduce SCM-based telemetry
- BYOVD operations where driver service creation is heavily monitored
- Testing EDR detections around registry-based driver service creation and `NtLoadDriver`
- Lab research on alternative kernel driver loading mechanisms and artifacts
