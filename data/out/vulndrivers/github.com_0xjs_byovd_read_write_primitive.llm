Title:
BYOVD Read Write primitive (RTCore64.sys toolkit)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository provides C proof-of-concept tooling for Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) using MSI Afterburner’s RTCore64.sys to gain kernel read/write primitives via IOCTLs.  
- It demonstrates how kernel memory access can be used to bypass or degrade Windows security controls, including disabling LSASS RunAsPPL, tampering with ETW TI (ETwTi), and removing EDR-related kernel callbacks/minifilter callback nodes.  
- The toolkit includes separate utilities for changing process protection (PS_PROTECTION), cloning/replacing process tokens (SYSTEM escalation or downgrading EDR processes), disabling DSE by patching g_CiOptions (when VBS is off), and enumerating/unlinking multiple callback types.  
- It relies on symbol-based offset resolution (downloading/parsing PDBs similar to EDRSandBlast) and/or hardcoded offsets keyed off Windows version (RtlGetVersion), and is tested on Windows 11 24H2 and Server 2022 21H2.  
- It is primarily useful for red teamers and security researchers studying kernel-mode evasion and telemetry suppression, and for defenders validating detections around vulnerable driver loading and kernel structure tampering.  
- The project highlights how a widely abused signed driver can be operationalized into modular post-exploitation primitives requiring local admin to load the driver.

Technical Focus:
- BYOVD via vulnerable signed driver (RTCore64.sys) and IOCTL-based kernel R/W
- Kernel callback enumeration/removal (Ps* notify routines, registry callbacks, object callbacks, minifilters)
- Process protection manipulation (RunAsPPL/PS_PROTECTION in _EPROCESS)
- ETW TI provider disabling (ProviderEnableInfo / GUID entry tampering)
- Token stealing/cloning via _EPROCESS Token (_EX_FAST_REF)
- DSE bypass by patching g_CiOptions (VBS-disabled scenarios) and unsigned driver loading

Use Cases:
- Disable LSASS RunAsPPL to enable credential access workflows
- Enumerate and unlink EDR telemetry callbacks/minifilters to reduce visibility
- Local privilege escalation to SYSTEM by token replacement
- Downgrade security product processes by replacing their tokens
- Temporarily disable DSE to load an unsigned driver in lab/assessment environments
- Research/detection engineering for vulnerable driver abuse and kernel tampering artifacts
