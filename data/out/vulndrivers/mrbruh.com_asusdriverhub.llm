Title:
One-Click RCE in ASUS’s Preinstalled Driver Software (ASUS DriverHub)

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This write-up analyzes ASUS DriverHub, a preinstalled/background driver management service that exposes a local RPC/HTTP API on `127.0.0.1:53000` and is controlled by `driverhub.asus.com`.  
- The core issue is an improper Origin validation that accepts attacker-controlled origins like `driverhub.asus.com.mrbruh.com`, enabling a malicious website to issue privileged API calls to the local service.  
- The author enumerates multiple endpoints (device inventory, log exfil, forced reboot, app install) and focuses on `UpdateApp`, which downloads arbitrary files and executes ASUS-signed executables with admin rights.  
- RCE is achieved by chaining: download an unsigned payload (left on disk), download a crafted `AsusSetup.ini`, then trigger execution of a signed ASUS `AsusSetup.exe` that performs a silent install and runs an attacker-chosen command via `SilentInstallRun`.  
- The report includes a disclosure timeline and references CVE-2025-3462 and CVE-2025-3463, highlighting the risk of “local web-to-system” attack surfaces created by vendor preinstalls.

Technical Focus:
- Localhost RPC/HTTP service exposure (`127.0.0.1` API on port 53000)
- Origin/CORS-style validation bypass via substring/wildcard matching
- File download + execution flow in updater endpoints (`UpdateApp`)
- Trust abuse of vendor code signing (ASUS-signed binary executed elevated)
- Installer configuration hijack (`AsusSetup.ini` + `SilentInstallRun`)
- Exploit chaining from web content to elevated code execution

Use Cases:
- Assessing OEM/preinstalled software attack surface on Windows endpoints
- Building web-to-localhost exploit chains against local agent APIs
- Auditing Origin/CORS checks and URL validation logic in local services
- Developing detections for suspicious localhost API calls and signed-binary LOLBins
- Validating patch effectiveness for CVE-2025-3462 / CVE-2025-3463
