Title:
Ghidra data type archive for Windows driver functions

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post announces a Cisco Talos release of a Ghidra Data Type Archive (.gdt) focused on Windows driver (kernel-mode) functions and data types.  
- It addresses a common reverse-engineering gap: Ghidra often lacks native definitions for many Windows driver structures/APIs, leading to poor type recovery and harder analysis.  
- Talos provides a supplemental GDT containing definitions they created during investigations of malicious drivers, including cases where Microsoft documentation is missing or incomplete.  
- The archive is positioned as an add-on to existing Windows/Ghidra type libraries, not a comprehensive replacement.  
- It’s useful primarily for malware analysts, reverse engineers, and red teamers analyzing kernel drivers, and it’s interesting because it operationalizes hard-won, real-world driver RE artifacts into reusable tooling.

Technical Focus:
- Ghidra Data Type Archives (.gdt) and type propagation
- Windows kernel / driver data types and function prototypes
- Reverse engineering malicious Windows drivers
- Handling undocumented or poorly documented kernel interfaces
- Improving decompilation accuracy via correct type information

Use Cases:
- Importing the GDT into Ghidra to improve disassembly/decompilation of Windows drivers
- Speeding up analysis of malicious or suspicious kernel-mode drivers by resolving unknown structs/APIs
- Building/maintaining internal RE type libraries by extending Talos’ definitions
- Standardizing driver RE workflows across a team (shared type knowledge)
