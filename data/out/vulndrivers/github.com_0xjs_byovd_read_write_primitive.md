# General

[Permalink: General](https://github.com/0xJs/BYOVD_read_write_primitive#general)

To practice Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) techniques from the CETP course, I set out to develop a toolkit leveraging a kernel-level read/write primitive to bypass security mechanisms such as LSASS’s RunasPPL protection and to enumerate and remove EDR telemetry via kernel callback manipulation. For the vulnerable driver, I used the well-known [RTCore64.sys](https://www.loldrivers.io/drivers/e32bc3da-4db1-4858-a62c-6fbe4db6afbd/) from MSI Afterburner.

# Proof of Concept code examples

[Permalink: Proof of Concept code examples](https://github.com/0xJs/BYOVD_read_write_primitive#proof-of-concept-code-examples)

This `C` project includes multiple proof-of-concept (POC) code examples that perform the following exploitation concepts:

- Changing Process Protection Levels
  - Disable Runasppl LSASS protection
- Removing Kernel Callbacks
- Disabling ETW providers
- Change process token
  - Privilege escalation to system
  - Downgrade EDR's token
- Disable DSE in case VBS is disabled and load unsigned driver

Requirements:

- All these attacks require local administrative privileges to load the vulnerable driver.

## Kernel Callback Remover

[Permalink: Kernel Callback Remover](https://github.com/0xJs/BYOVD_read_write_primitive#kernel-callback-remover)

- What does it do
  - Calculates and prints offsets by downloading symbols from the internet as in EDRSandBlast project for all kernel callbacks and their structures.
  - Writes vulnerable RTCore64 driver to `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\RTCore64.sys` and loads the driver.
  - Enumerate all loaded kernel drivers on the system
  - Enumerates all kernel callbacks and if `-d` selected also removes or unlinks them using the read and write IOCTL

    - Process Creation Kernel Callbacks - Removed through overwriting the callback address with `0x0`
    - Thread Creation Kernel Callbacks - Removed through overwriting the callback address with \`0x0
    - Image Loading Kernel Callbacks - Removed through overwriting the callback address with \`0x0
    - Registry Operations Kernel Callbacks - Removed through pointing the flink and blink to dwListHead (itself)
    - Object Creation Kernel Callbacks
      - Process - Removed through pointing the flink and blink to dwListHead (itself)
      - Thread - Removed through pointing the flink and blink to dwListHead (itself)
    - Minifilter Kernel Callbacks and their callbacknodes - Removed through unlinking the callbacknodes
  - Compare callback addresses with the loaded kernel drivers to check to which driver the callback belongs
  - Unloads the RTCore64 driver and removes the file from `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\RTCore64.sys`
- Filenames can be configured in `config.h`

```
PS C:\ > .\KernelCallbackRemover.exe
Usage: KernelCallbackRemover.exe -l / -d
