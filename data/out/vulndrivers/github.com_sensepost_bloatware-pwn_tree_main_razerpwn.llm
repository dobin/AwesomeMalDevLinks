Title:
razerpwn — Razer Synapse 4 razer_elevation_service.exe LPE PoC (CVE-2025-27811)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
This repository contains a local privilege escalation proof-of-concept targeting Razer Synapse 4’s `razer_elevation_service.exe` v1.1.0.5 (CVE-2025-27811). It demonstrates abusing a Razer COM component (`RzUtility.Elevator`) to launch an arbitrary process with elevated privileges via `LaunchProcessNoWait`. The project includes a patched `simple_service.dll` where a PE signature validation routine is removed, indicating the original service/DLL enforces signature checks that the PoC bypasses. Build instructions are provided for Visual Studio, and a minimal PowerShell one-liner is included as an alternative exploit path. It is primarily useful for red teams and pentesters assessing endpoint bloatware attack surface, and for defenders validating exposure and detection opportunities around vendor “elevation” services.

Technical Focus:
- Windows local privilege escalation via vendor “elevation service”
- COM automation abuse (`RzUtility.Elevator`)
- Arbitrary process execution with elevated context (`LaunchProcessNoWait`)
- DLL patching to bypass PE/signature validation (function offset patching)
- PoC implementation in Visual Studio/C++

Use Cases:
- Validate and reproduce CVE-2025-27811 on endpoints with Razer Synapse 4 installed
- Demonstrate bloatware-assisted privilege escalation during internal red team engagements
- Create detection logic for suspicious COM object instantiation and elevated process launches
- Assess hardening needs (removal/disablement of vulnerable vendor services, application control)
