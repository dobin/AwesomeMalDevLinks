Title:
Reversing Bits Cheatsheets

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository is a curated collection of cheatsheets covering reverse engineering, binary analysis, and assembly programming tooling.  
- It solves the “quick reference” problem by consolidating installation steps, common commands, usage examples, and advanced tips across multiple OSes into one place (also published as a GitHub Pages site).  
- The content spans the typical RE workflow: static inspection (file/strings/readelf/objdump), debugging and dynamic analysis (GDB/WinDbg/OllyDbg/QEMU/Valgrind/Unicorn), and decompilation/disassembly (IDA/Ghidra/Binary Ninja/radare2/Rizin/RetDec).  
- It also includes binary analysis/instrumentation frameworks (angr, Frida, PIN, Capstone, Triton, Dyninst) and malware-focused utilities (YARA, Diaphora, zynamics, fuzzing with Spike).  
- Useful for reverse engineers, vulnerability researchers, CTF players, malware analysts, and red teamers who need fast command recall and tool-specific workflows.  
- Interesting as a broad, tool-agnostic reference that bridges Linux and Windows RE stacks in a single index.

Technical Focus:
- Static binary triage (ELF/object introspection, symbols, strings)
- Debugging & dynamic analysis (breakpoints, tracing, emulation/virtualization)
- Disassembly and decompilation workflows
- Dynamic instrumentation and binary rewriting frameworks
- Symbolic execution / program analysis frameworks
- Malware analysis primitives (YARA, diffing, fuzzing)

Use Cases:
- Rapid lookup of commands/options for common RE tools during engagements or CTFs
- Building a repeatable workflow for ELF/PE triage and deeper analysis
- Setting up debugging environments (GDB/WinDbg) and emulation (QEMU/Unicorn)
- Automating analysis with frameworks like angr/Frida/PIN/Triton
- Malware hunting and family clustering via YARA and binary diffing (Diaphora/zynamics)
