Title:
BlackSnufkin/BYOVD — Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver PoCs for AV/EDR termination

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository is a collection of Windows BYOVD proof-of-concepts showing how vulnerable kernel drivers can be abused from user mode to terminate AV/EDR processes.  
- It addresses the practical problem of discovering, reverse engineering, and operationalizing “process killer” drivers that expose dangerous IOCTLs (often allowing arbitrary PID termination as SYSTEM).  
- The project is implemented as a Rust Cargo workspace with a shared `byovd-lib` that manages driver service lifecycle, device handle/IOCTL dispatch, process monitoring, and cleanup, while each PoC only defines driver-specific parameters (device path, IOCTL, input format).  
- It includes multiple driver-specific “killer” modules (e.g., TfSysMon, STProcessMonitor, K7RKScan, BdApiUtil64, wsftprm) and references real-world abuse (e.g., TfSysMon used in EDRKillShifter campaigns).  
- The README also provides an end-to-end x64 driver RE methodology: import screening (ZwOpenProcess/ZwTerminateProcess), tracing DriverEntry → IRP dispatch → IOCTL handler → vulnerable routine, and reconstructing input buffer layouts.  
- Useful for red teams, pentesters, and security researchers validating BYOVD risk; also valuable for blue teams building detections/block rules and driver allow/block strategies.

Technical Focus:
- BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) tradecraft
- Windows kernel driver IOCTL abuse (IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL, DeviceIoControl)
- Driver reverse engineering workflow (DriverEntry, dispatch tables, symbolic links)
- Process termination primitives via ZwOpenProcess/ZwTerminateProcess
- Rust tooling for driver service management (SCM create/start/stop/delete)
- Driver blocklisting context (LOLDrivers, Microsoft recommended driver block rules, HVCI considerations)

Use Cases:
- Reproduce and study BYOVD-based EDR/AV process termination techniques in a lab
- Rapidly prototype new vulnerable-driver PoCs by implementing `DriverConfig`
- Validate whether a driver exposes a “process killer” IOCTL and determine buffer format/offsets
- Build defensive detections around suspicious driver loading + IOCTL patterns + targeted security process kills
- Support threat emulation of ransomware-style EDR disruption chains
