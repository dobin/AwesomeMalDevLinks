Title:
Offensive-Windows-Drivers-Development

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- A research/learning repository focused on building Windows kernel-mode and user-mode drivers for offensive security scenarios.  
- It demonstrates low-level Windows internals interaction such as file system I/O interception, process manipulation/injection from kernel space, and direct memory operations.  
- The repo includes PoC driver projects (e.g., a “GetSystem” privilege escalation example and a ransomware-themed project with kernel-level AES file encryption).  
- It also highlights EDR evasion concepts achievable via kernel drivers, framing them as techniques defenders should understand and mitigate.  
- Useful for red teamers, malware developers, and vulnerability researchers learning WDK-based driver development; also relevant to blue teams for understanding attacker tradecraft and driver-abuse patterns.  
- Interesting because it bridges practical driver code with offensive use cases that commonly bypass user-mode controls.

Technical Focus:
- Windows kernel-mode driver development (WDK, KMDF/WDM concepts)
- File system interception / filter-like I/O monitoring
- Kernel memory manipulation and process operations
- Privilege escalation to SYSTEM from kernel context
- Kernel-assisted process injection / manipulation
- EDR evasion via kernel-level capabilities

Use Cases:
- Build and test PoC kernel drivers for offensive R&D in lab environments
- Study kernel-level file I/O interception and tampering techniques
- Prototype SYSTEM privilege escalation primitives for post-exploitation
- Explore kernel-based encryption workflows (ransomware simulation)
- Develop detection ideas for malicious/vulnerable driver behaviors (IOCTL abuse, suspicious callbacks)
