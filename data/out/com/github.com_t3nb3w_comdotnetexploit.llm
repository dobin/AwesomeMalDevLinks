Title:
ComDotNetExploit (PPL Exploit PoC via COM-to-.NET Redirection)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository provides a C++ proof-of-concept for injecting code into Windows Protected Process Light (PPL) targets (e.g., svchost PPL and potentially LSASS) by abusing COM-to-.NET redirection and .NET reflection.  
- It demonstrates how registry-based COM activation can be redirected to a .NET object and invoked via IDispatch, enabling execution inside a highly protected process context.  
- The key bypass is using `Assembly.Load(byte[])` (reflection) to load payload bytes in-memory, avoiding PPL’s typical code integrity enforcement associated with SEC_IMAGE image section creation.  
- The PoC is based on James Forshaw’s research on “trapped” COM objects and IDispatch access patterns.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers, exploit developers, and defenders studying PPL bypass primitives and COM/.NET abuse chains.  
- It’s interesting because it highlights a practical path to execute unsigned code in PPL contexts without relying on traditional signed DLL loading.

Technical Focus:
- Protected Process Light (PPL) and code integrity enforcement (SEC_IMAGE)
- COM activation hijacking via registry manipulation (COM-to-.NET redirection)
- IDispatch-based access to “trapped” COM objects
- .NET reflection and in-memory assembly loading (`Assembly.Load(byte[])`)
- Payload execution/injection inside protected Windows processes

Use Cases:
- Researching and validating PPL bypass techniques in lab environments
- Developing detections for COM registry tampering and suspicious COM activation paths
- Studying .NET in-memory loading tradecraft used to evade image-based integrity checks
- Building defensive test cases for LSASS/PPL hardening and monitoring
