Title:
COMmander

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- COMmander is a C#/.NET utility that enriches Windows defensive telemetry for RPC and COM activity by consuming low-level events from the `Microsoft-Windows-RPC` ETW provider.  
- It addresses the common visibility gap where COM/DCOM and RPC-based tradecraft is hard to attribute and detect using higher-level logs alone.  
- The tool runs either as a CLI or a Windows service, continuously monitoring ETW and triggering alerts when events match user-defined detection rules.  
- Rules are provided via an XML configuration and can filter on RPC interface UUID, operation number (OpNum), endpoint (e.g., named pipes), network address, and process name.  
- It is primarily useful for Blue Teams/defenders and detection engineers, but also valuable for red teams to understand what RPC/COM behaviors are observable and how they might be detected.  
- Notable examples include detections for DCOM-triggered WebClient activity and authentication coercion patterns like PetitPotam’s EFSRPC calls.

Technical Focus:
- ETW collection via `Microsoft-Windows-RPC` provider
- RPC interface UUID and OpNum-based detection
- COM/DCOM activity visibility through RPC telemetry
- Rule-driven filtering and alerting (XML ruleset)
- Windows service deployment and Event Viewer logging

Use Cases:
- Detect RPC-based authentication coercion (e.g., EFSRPC/PetitPotam-style activity)
- Monitor DCOM/RPC named-pipe endpoints for suspicious activation patterns
- Build host-based detections keyed on interface UUID + OpNum combinations
- Enrich incident response timelines with granular RPC call metadata
- Validate/red-team test detection coverage for COM/RPC tradecraft
