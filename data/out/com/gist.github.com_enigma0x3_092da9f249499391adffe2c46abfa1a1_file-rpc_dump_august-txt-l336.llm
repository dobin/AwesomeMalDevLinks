Title:
RPC interfaces dump August 2018 (Windows RPC/COM endpoint inventory)

Type:
Documentation

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This gist is a raw dump of RPC interfaces and endpoints exposed by Windows processes/services on a specific system snapshot (August 2018), mapping UUIDs, versions, procedure names, backing binaries (DLL/EXE), and endpoint bindings.  
- It effectively inventories the local RPC attack surface by showing which processes register which RPC servers and how they are reachable (e.g., `ncalrpc`, `ncacn_np` named pipes, `ncacn_ip_tcp` ports).  
- The output includes high-value subsystems like Service Control Manager (`services.exe` / `ntsvcs`), LSASS/LSA/SAMR (`lsasrv.dll`, `samsrv.dll`, `keyiso.dll`, `vaultsvc.dll`), Task Scheduler (`schedsvc.dll` / `atsvc`), Event Log (`wevtsvc.dll`), and RPCSS/EPM (`rpcss.dll`, `rpcepmap.dll`).  
- It’s useful for red teams and exploit developers to identify reachable RPC endpoints for lateral movement, privilege escalation research, coercion primitives, or fuzzing targets, and for blue teams to baseline/monitor unexpected RPC servers.  
- The inclusion of procedure name lists per interface helps correlate UUIDs to functionality when reversing or building RPC clients.  

Technical Focus:
- MSRPC interface UUIDs, versions, and opnum/procedure mapping
- RPC endpoint bindings: `ncalrpc`, `ncacn_np` (named pipes), `ncacn_ip_tcp` (TCP ports)
- Windows service RPC surfaces (SCM, Task Scheduler, Event Log, Workstation service)
- Security-sensitive RPC servers (LSA/SAMR/DPAPI/KeyIso/Vault)
- COM/DCOM/OLE RPC interfaces (IRundown, IRemUnknown, activators)
- Endpoint Mapper (EPM) and RPCSS infrastructure

Use Cases:
- Enumerate and prioritize RPC endpoints for fuzzing and vulnerability research
- Map named pipes/ports to owning services for lateral movement planning
- Identify LSASS/SCM/Scheduler RPC primitives relevant to credential access or service/task manipulation
- Build detections/baselines for anomalous RPC interface registrations on endpoints
- Assist reverse engineering by linking interface UUIDs to modules and exported RPC stubs
