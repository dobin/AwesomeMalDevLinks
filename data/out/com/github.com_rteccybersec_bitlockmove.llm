Title:
BitlockMove — Lateral Movement via BitLocker DCOM Interfaces & COM Hijacking

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
BitlockMove is a C# proof-of-concept for lateral movement that abuses BitLocker-related DCOM/COM classes configured to run as `INTERACTIVE USER`, causing processes to spawn in the context of the currently logged-on user session. It remotely sets up a COM hijack via the Remote Registry, drops a malicious DLL over SMB, and triggers execution by invoking a BitLocker DCOM interface so the target process loads the attacker-controlled DLL. The PoC uses the BDEUILauncher COM class (CLSID `ab93b6f1-be76-4185-a488-a9001b105b94`, IID `IBDEUILauncher`) to start `BaaUpdate.exe`, which is shown as vulnerable to COM hijacking and attempts to load CLSID `A7A63E5C-3877-4840-8727-C1EA9D7A4D50`. This enables code execution directly in the logged-in user context without first fully compromising the system, potentially reducing artifacts compared to spawning new unsigned processes. It is primarily applicable to Windows client endpoints where BitLocker components are present/enabled, and less applicable to servers where BitLocker is typically disabled by default. The repo also outlines detection ideas focused on remote COM hijack registry changes, DLL load events in `BaaUpdate.exe`, and suspicious child processes.

Technical Focus:
- DCOM activation and COM class identity (`INTERACTIVE USER`)
- Remote COM hijacking via Remote Registry (CLSID/InprocServer32 manipulation)
- DLL planting/delivery over SMB and subsequent DLL load
- BitLocker/BDE UI COM interfaces (BDEUILauncher / `IBDEUILauncher`)
- User-context code execution and post-exploitation pivoting
- Behavioral detection opportunities (registry + module load + process tree)

Use Cases:
- Lateral movement to a workstation where a user is actively logged in
- Executing payloads in a specific user session without service/system takeover
- Red team tradecraft research on COM identity abuse and signed-process execution
- Blue team detection engineering for remote COM hijack + suspicious DLL loads
- Lab validation of BitLocker-related COM attack surface on endpoints
