Title:
RPCMon (RPC Monitor) – ETW-based RPC Communication Monitor

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
RPCMon is a Windows GUI tool that monitors and visualizes RPC communication between processes using Event Tracing for Windows (ETW). It aims to provide a Procmon-like view of RPC activity, showing which processes invoke which RPC functions and related metadata. To resolve RPC interface/function details, it uses a hardcoded RPC dictionary and can also build/load an RPC database (UUID/module mappings) from the local system to improve coverage. The project leverages James Forshaw’s NtApiDotNet/.NET RPC capabilities to decode and label RPC calls. It’s useful for red teamers, pentesters, malware analysts, and defenders who need to understand or triage RPC-based behavior (including container/host RPC interactions). The key value is making opaque RPC traffic more attributable to specific interfaces and functions for research, detection engineering, and troubleshooting.

Technical Focus:
- Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) collection and parsing
- Windows RPC internals (interfaces, UUIDs, endpoints, function calls)
- RPC interface/function mapping via local database generation
- Process-to-RPC call attribution (caller process context)
- NtApiDotNet / .NET RPC decoding (James Forshaw tooling)

Use Cases:
- Investigate suspicious inter-process RPC activity and identify invoked RPC functions
- Reverse engineer or baseline RPC behavior of Windows services and security products
- Analyze Windows container ↔ host RPC communication paths
- Build detections/hunts around unusual RPC interfaces, call patterns, or callers
- Troubleshoot RPC-heavy applications by correlating processes to RPC calls
