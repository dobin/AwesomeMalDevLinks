Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- FullBypass is a C#/.NET MSBuild project intended to bypass Windows AMSI and PowerShell Constrained Language Mode (CLM) to obtain a FullLanguage PowerShell reverse shell.  
- It targets environments where PowerShell script content is scanned by AMSI and where CLM restricts available language features and module loading.  
- The repository describes an AMSI bypass implemented via in-memory patching (“memory hijacking”) of `AmsiScanBuffer`, modifying instructions so the scan size argument becomes zero, reducing visibility of subsequent PowerShell content.  
- After patching, it prompts for attacker IP/port and establishes a reverse shell running in FullLanguage mode, with guidance to load modules via `DownloadString` + `IEX` to preserve capability.  
- Delivery/execution is framed as “living off the land” by placing the `.csproj` on disk and running it with `msbuild.exe` from the .NET Framework directory.  
- Useful primarily for red teams and pentesters assessing PowerShell/AMSI/CLM controls and for defenders studying common bypass patterns and MSBuild abuse tradecraft.

Technical Focus:
- AMSI bypass via in-memory patching of `AmsiScanBuffer`
- PowerShell CLM bypass / achieving FullLanguage mode
- MSBuild (`msbuild.exe`) abuse for code execution (csproj inline task technique)
- Reverse shell implementation over TCP
- PowerShell in-memory module loading (`DownloadString`, `IEX`)

Use Cases:
- Establishing a FullLanguage PowerShell foothold in CLM-restricted environments
- Bypassing AMSI content scanning to run post-exploitation PowerShell
- Demonstrating MSBuild-based application whitelisting/LOLBin abuse paths
- Defensive testing: validating AMSI/CLM enforcement and monitoring coverage
- Building detections around `msbuild.exe` spawning PowerShell/network beacons and AMSI tampering
