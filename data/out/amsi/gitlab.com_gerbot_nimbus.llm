Title:
Nimbus — Minimal C# Reflective Loader

Type:
GitHub Tool (GitLab repository)

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
Nimbus is a minimal C# reflective loader that downloads a remote .NET executable and runs it in-memory, aimed at offensive security workflows. It solves the problem of repeatedly staging and executing common post-exploitation .NET tools without writing them to disk, while remaining CLI-argument friendly. The project uses a JSON config (`nimbus.json`) to map short command flags (e.g., `--rubeus`, `--seatbelt`) to URLs and supports “pipelines” to chain multiple tool executions into repeatable playbooks. It includes an optional AMSI patching toggle (`--amsi`) to improve execution reliability against Windows defenses. It’s primarily useful for red teamers, pentesters, and CTF players who want lightweight automation around in-memory execution of compiled C# tooling. Noted limitations include reduced reliability on Windows Server 2016–2022.

Technical Focus:
- In-memory execution / reflective loading of .NET assemblies
- Remote payload retrieval over HTTP(S)
- AMSI patching/bypass toggle
- JSON-driven command mapping and execution pipelines
- Windows/.NET Framework compilation and runtime behavior
- Tooling orchestration for post-exploitation tradecraft

Use Cases:
- Execute GhostPack-style .NET tooling (e.g., Rubeus/Seatbelt/SharpUp) from memory via URL
- Build repeatable enumeration/privesc pipelines for engagements and labs
- Reduce disk artifacts by avoiding writing executables to the filesystem
- Rapid operator workflow: alias common tools/arguments behind short flags
- Test AMSI-related execution behavior in controlled environments
