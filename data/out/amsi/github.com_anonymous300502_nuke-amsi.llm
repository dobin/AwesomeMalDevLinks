Title:
Nuke-AMSI (NukeAMSI.ps1)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Nuke-AMSI is a PowerShell script intended to disable/neutralize Windows AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) within a running PowerShell process.  
- It aims to bypass script-content scanning by modifying the in-memory behavior of `amsi.dll`, enabling execution of payloads that would otherwise be blocked (the README demonstrates this with Mimikatz).  
- The repository describes using low-level Windows API/NTDLL routines to open a process, change memory protections, and write to target memory (e.g., `NtOpenProcess`, `NtWriteVirtualMemory`, `VirtualProtectEx`).  
- The approach is positioned as “in-memory” and “stealth,” focusing on direct memory manipulation rather than dropping patched binaries to disk.  
- The author notes the current version is detected and suggests obfuscation/crypting to evade signatures.  
- Useful primarily for red teams, penetration testers, and security researchers studying AMSI bypass tradecraft and defensive implications.

Technical Focus:
- AMSI internals and `amsi.dll` tampering
- PowerShell-based in-memory patching
- Windows native API usage via NTDLL (syscalls/native functions)
- Process memory operations (open process, write memory)
- Memory protection changes (RWX/RX transitions via `VirtualProtectEx`)

Use Cases:
- Bypassing AMSI scanning in a PowerShell session during authorized engagements
- Researching how AMSI bypasses work and how EDR/AV detect memory patching
- Building detections around suspicious `NtWriteVirtualMemory`/`VirtualProtectEx` patterns targeting `amsi.dll`
- Testing defensive controls (AMSI, Defender, EDR) against in-memory tamper techniques
