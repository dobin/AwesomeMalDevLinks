GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository is a collection of PowerShell-based AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) bypass/avoidance techniques aggregated from various public blog posts and research.  
- It targets the problem of PowerShell payloads being scanned and blocked at runtime by AMSI-enabled defenders (e.g., Windows Defender and other AMSI providers).  
- The repo demonstrates multiple approaches including in-memory patching of AMSI-related functions (e.g., `AmsiScanBuffer`, `AmsiOpenSession`), CLR-level modifications/hooking, ScriptBlock AST manipulation (“ScriptBlock Smuggling”), provider DLL patching (e.g., `MpOav.dll`), and interception of AMSI provider scan callbacks.  
- It also notes that many included scripts are signature-detected and suggests using trigger-finding and obfuscation/manual signature modification to restore effectiveness.  
- Useful primarily for red teams, pentesters, and offensive security researchers testing PowerShell tradecraft against modern Windows defenses; also relevant to blue teams for understanding bypass primitives and building detections.  
- Interesting because it covers a broad spectrum of bypass classes (reflection-only toggles through low-level memory patching and breakpoint-based manipulation), illustrating how AMSI can be subverted at different layers.

Technical Focus:
- AMSI internals and bypass primitives (`AmsiScanBuffer`, `AmsiOpenSession`, `AmsiUtils.ScanContent`)
- In-memory patching and memory protection changes (`VirtualProtect`, `WriteProcessMemory`, `ReadProcessMemory`)
- CLR/.NET method patching & hooking (`RuntimeHelpers.PrepareMethod`, function pointer swapping)
- PowerShell AST/ScriptBlock manipulation (ScriptBlock smuggling)
- AMSI provider manipulation (patching `MpOav.dll`, provider scan interception via vtables)
- Evasion workflow: signature triggers + obfuscation (AMSITrigger, Invoke-Obfuscation/ISESteroids)

Use Cases:
- Bypassing AMSI in a PowerShell session to execute post-exploitation frameworks or loaders
- Testing EDR/AV resilience and detection coverage against common AMSI bypass families
- Developing/benchmarking detections for memory patching, reflection-based tampering, and provider hooking
- Red-team tradecraft research: comparing reliability of reflection toggles vs. low-level patching vs. AST tricks
