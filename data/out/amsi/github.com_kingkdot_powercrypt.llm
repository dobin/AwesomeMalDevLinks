Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
PowerCrypt is a C#-based PowerShell script obfuscator that claims to provide fast, robust obfuscation by parsing and transforming scripts via the PowerShell Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It targets static detection by AV/EDR by rewriting code structure rather than relying on simple string/regex substitutions. The repo provides prebuilt releases and supports building from source in Visual Studio, including .NET AOT publishing for easier distribution and potentially reduced runtime dependencies. Usage is straightforward: supply a PowerShell script path via GUI prompt or command-line argument to output an obfuscated version. This is primarily useful for red teams and penetration testers who need to alter PowerShell payloads to test detection coverage and resilience. It’s notable for emphasizing AST-aware transformations and performance (sub-millisecond processing cited for ~21KB scripts).

Technical Focus:
- PowerShell AST parsing and code transformation
- Static detection evasion via structural obfuscation
- .NET/C# implementation of an obfuscation pipeline
- Cross-platform execution and packaging
- AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation/publishing

Use Cases:
- Obfuscate PowerShell tradecraft for controlled red-team exercises
- Generate variant payloads to evaluate AV/EDR static detection and signatures
- Automate large-scale script rewriting in build pipelines (AOT/release binaries)
- Create reproducible obfuscation profiles/settings for different test scenarios
