Title:
TrampoLatté (TrampoLatte) — AMSI & ETW bypass PoC via trampoline hooking

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- TrampoLatté is a proof-of-concept that bypasses AMSI scanning and suppresses ETW telemetry by trampoline-hooking key Windows functions and altering control flow.  
- It targets `AmsiScanBuffer` to force a clean result (e.g., returning `AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN`) and targets ETW by hooking `EtwpEventWriteFull` to short-circuit event emission (a simple `ret` stub).  
- The core technique is inline patching with a small jump stub (documented as a 13-byte `jmp r10`) that redirects execution into proxy/stub code, then returns to the caller with modified behavior.  
- The repo includes C and a small amount of assembly, and demonstrates the effect using a custom ETW consumer monitoring .NET runtime events.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers, offensive tool developers, and defenders studying common user-mode telemetry bypass patterns; the author notes it is not OPSEC-safe.

Technical Focus:
- Trampoline/inline hooking and control-flow redirection
- AMSI bypass by manipulating `AmsiScanBuffer` return semantics
- ETW suppression by hooking `EtwpEventWriteFull`
- Context saving/restoring in hook proxies
- User-mode telemetry evasion against .NET runtime ETW consumers

Use Cases:
- Building or studying AMSI bypass primitives for in-process execution
- Disabling/suppressing ETW-based detections during .NET assembly execution
- Researching detection opportunities for inline patching/trampoline hooks
- Creating lab PoCs to validate EDR/ETW/AMSI monitoring coverage
