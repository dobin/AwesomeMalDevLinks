## What is this?

[Permalink: What is this?](https://github.com/bananabr/CLRInjector#what-is-this)

A proof-of-concept process injection tool that mixes Adam Chester's ( [@XPN](https://twitter.com/_xpn_)) "Weird Ways to Run Unmanaged Code in .NET" and Ceri Coburn's ( [@ _EthicalChaos_](https://twitter.com/_ethicalchaos_)) "Needles Without The Thread: Threadless Process Injection - Ceri Coburn".

## How does it work?

[Permalink: How does it work?](https://github.com/bananabr/CLRInjector#how-does-it-work)

- List target processes

```
CLRInjector.exe --ps
```

- Dump GC heap (similar to SOS.dll !dumpheap)

```
CLRInjector.exe <pid|process_name> --dump-obj
```

- Dump method tables (similar to SOS.dll !dumpmt)

```
CLRInjector.exe <pid|process_name> --dump-mt 0x1122334455667788
```

- Dump method descriptor (similar to SOS.dll !dumpmd)

```
CLRInjector.exe <pid|process_name> --dump-md 0x1122334455667788
```

- Dump trampolines (injection targets)

```
CLRInjector.exe <pid|process_name> --dump-trampolines
```

- Hook Jitted method and loads shellcode into preexisting RWX segment

```
CLRInjector.exe <pid|process_name> --inject <payload path> <method_desc>
```

## Known issues

[Permalink: Known issues](https://github.com/bananabr/CLRInjector#known-issues)

- To reserve space for the shellcode, the tool updates the JIT Manager loader code heap m\_pAllocPtr. This keeps future JIT allocations from overwriting the payload. There is a chance of a race condition if m\_pAllocPtr is updated by the JIT manager after its read but before its patched by the tool.
- For now, the shellcode must support being called as a function and return, otherwise it may crash the target process. A generic stub that loads the shellcode on its own thread would most likely solve this.
