Title:
MemLoader — In-memory PE and .NET loader (Cobalt Strike UDRL-compatible)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- MemLoader is a proof-of-concept framework that executes native Windows PE executables and .NET assemblies entirely from memory.  
- It provides two separate loaders: a reflective PE loader for unmanaged `.exe` payloads and a .NET loader that hosts the CLR to run managed assemblies.  
- Payloads are intended to be embedded at build time (optionally RC4-encrypted via a helper script) so the executed binary never touches disk after the loader starts.  
- The project includes multiple evasion-oriented techniques such as indirect syscall stubs, string reconstruction for API resolution, and (for the .NET loader) AMSI/ETW patching using hardware breakpoints plus thread-start hooking via `BaseThreadInitThunk`.  
- It also attempts to reduce common memory-hunting heuristics (e.g., wiping DOS headers in unbacked regions) and uses `RtlCaptureContext`/`NtContinue` to avoid context-thread API detections.  
- Useful primarily for red teams, pentesters, and implant developers experimenting with in-memory execution tradecraft and UDRL-style integration.

Technical Focus:
- Reflective PE loading / in-memory execution
- CLR hosting and managed assembly execution
- RC4 payload encryption and compile-time embedding
- Indirect syscalls for `Nt*` APIs
- AMSI & ETW patching via hardware breakpoints (HWBP)
- Thread start redirection (`BaseThreadInitThunk`), context manipulation (`RtlCaptureContext`, `NtContinue`)

Use Cases:
- Execute post-exploitation payloads without writing the payload to disk
- Build Cobalt Strike-compatible UDRL DLL loaders for in-memory tasking
- Run .NET tooling in-memory while attempting to suppress AMSI/ETW telemetry
- Prototype and test memory-scanning/heuristic bypass ideas (e.g., header wiping)
- Convert loader DLLs to shellcode for specific UDRL workflows
