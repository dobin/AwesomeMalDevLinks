Title:
CLRInjector — .NET/CLR-Specific Process Injection PoC (JIT Method Hooking + RWX Code Heap)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
CLRInjector is a proof-of-concept Windows process injection tool targeting .NET (CLR) processes by abusing CLR internals rather than classic remote-thread injection. It enumerates managed runtime structures (GC heap objects, MethodTables, MethodDescriptors) and identifies JIT “trampolines” as candidate hook points. The injection technique hooks a JITted managed method and places shellcode into an already-existing RWX region associated with the CLR JIT code heap, aiming to avoid allocating new executable memory. It also patches the JIT Manager loader code heap allocation pointer (m_pAllocPtr) to reserve space so later JIT activity doesn’t overwrite the payload, with an acknowledged race-condition risk. The project is mainly useful for red teamers, pentesters, and researchers exploring stealthier .NET tradecraft and CLR memory manipulation, and for defenders wanting to understand detection opportunities around CLRMD-like inspection and JIT tampering.

Technical Focus:
- CLR internals: GC heap, MethodTable, MethodDescriptor, JIT structures
- JIT method hooking / runtime method replacement
- “Threadless”/non-CreateRemoteThread style injection concepts
- Reuse of pre-existing RWX memory (JIT code heap) for payload placement
- CLR memory inspection/dumping (SOS-like functionality, CLRMD concepts)
- Loader/JIT allocation pointer manipulation (m_pAllocPtr)

Use Cases:
- Inject shellcode into a running .NET process by hijacking a JITted method
- Enumerate and analyze managed runtime metadata in a target process (heap/MT/MD)
- Identify viable JIT trampoline targets for method-level hooks
- Research/demonstrate EDR-relevant telemetry around CLR/JIT tampering
- Build or test detections for abnormal JIT code heap modifications and method patching
