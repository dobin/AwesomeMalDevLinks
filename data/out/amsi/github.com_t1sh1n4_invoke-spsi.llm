Title:
Invoke-SPSI – Simple PowerShell Shellcode Injector

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Invoke-SPSI is a PowerShell-based shellcode injector that decrypts an XOR-encrypted payload in memory and injects it into a remote target process.  
- It uses a .NET D/Invoke approach to call Win32 APIs without traditional P/Invoke signatures, aiming to reduce static detections in the script itself.  
- The repo includes a small Python helper (xor.py) to XOR-encode raw shellcode and a PowerShell script (Invoke-SPSI.ps1) that fetches the encrypted payload from disk or URL, decrypts it, and performs remote process injection.  
- The author positions it as a CTF/lightweight lab tool demonstrating that Windows Defender can sometimes be bypassed even with highly signatured payloads (e.g., Meterpreter) using simple obfuscation + injection.  
- It explicitly does not claim to bypass modern EDR or paid AV, and warns against real engagement use.  
- Useful primarily for red teamers/pentesters in controlled environments and for defenders studying common injection tradecraft and detection opportunities.

Technical Focus:
- XOR payload obfuscation and in-memory decryption
- PowerShell loader patterns (IEX/IWR, local/remote payload retrieval)
- .NET D/Invoke to access Win32 APIs
- Remote process injection workflow (allocate/write/execute in target process)
- Basic AV (Windows Defender) evasion via trivial encoding + API indirection

Use Cases:
- Demonstrating process injection fundamentals in Windows labs/CTFs
- Testing Defender-only environments against simple in-memory loaders
- Building detection content for script-based injection + remote memory operations
- Rapid prototyping of PowerShell tradecraft (payload staging, decryption, injection)
