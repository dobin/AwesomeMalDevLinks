Title:
PowerChell — Unmanaged PowerShell console with security features disabled

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- PowerChell is a proof-of-concept PowerShell host implemented in C/C++ that launches a PowerShell 5.1 console while patching/neutralizing common PowerShell security controls.  
- It targets defenses such as AMSI, Script Block Logging, Module Logging, Transcription, Execution Policy enforcement, and Constrained Language Mode (CLM) to reduce visibility and restrictions during interactive use.  
- The project can be built as either an EXE (interactive console) or a DLL (invokable via rundll32), and also supports a `-c` option to run a single command.  
- By design it avoids loading modules; optionally loading PSReadLine enables UX features but introduces an OPSEC tradeoff by writing command history to a file often monitored by EDR.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teams, pentesters, and offensive security researchers exploring unmanaged hosting and in-process patching of PowerShell/CLR-related telemetry and policy controls.  
- It’s interesting because it consolidates multiple PowerShell hardening bypasses into a custom host rather than relying on `powershell.exe`, highlighting detection gaps and monitoring opportunities.

Technical Focus:
- Unmanaged PowerShell hosting (custom console host in C/C++)
- AMSI bypass/patching (in-process)
- PowerShell logging bypass (ScriptBlock/Module/Transcription)
- Constrained Language Mode (CLM) bypass techniques
- Execution Policy bypass mechanics
- OPSEC considerations around PSReadLine history artifacts

Use Cases:
- Run PowerShell interactively without standard logging/AMSI enforcement
- Execute one-off PowerShell commands via `-c` in a reduced-telemetry host
- Deliver PowerShell capability via DLL execution (e.g., `rundll32`) for tradecraft experimentation
- Research/demonstrate how EDRs detect PowerShell outside `powershell.exe` and via alternative artifacts (e.g., PSReadLine history)
- Build and test defensive detections for unmanaged PowerShell hosts and in-memory patching
