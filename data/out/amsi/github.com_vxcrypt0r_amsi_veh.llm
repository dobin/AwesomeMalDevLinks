Title:
AMSI Bypass via VEH (AMSI_VEH)

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This repository demonstrates a PowerShell AMSI bypass that uses a Vectored Exception Handler (VEH) rather than patching instructions, API hooking, or IAT modification.  
- The approach requires injecting a DLL into the target PowerShell process (either via a provided basic injector or via DLL hijacking).  
- It sets hardware breakpoints on `AmsiScanBuffer` across PowerShell threads and registers a VEH to catch the resulting exceptions.  
- When `AmsiScanBuffer` is invoked, the VEH forces an early return and sets the scan result to `AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN`, effectively neutralizing AMSI scanning without modifying code bytes.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teamers, pentesters, and malware developers exploring stealthier AMSI bypass primitives and for defenders studying detection opportunities around VEH/debug-register abuse.

Technical Focus:
- AMSI internals and `AmsiScanBuffer` interception
- Vectored Exception Handling (AddVectoredExceptionHandler)
- Hardware breakpoints / debug registers (DR0–DR7) across threads
- DLL injection and DLL hijacking tradecraft
- Thread context manipulation / forced function return

Use Cases:
- Bypassing AMSI scanning in PowerShell without inline patching or classic hooks
- Researching stealthy user-mode interception techniques using VEH + hardware breakpoints
- Building and testing detections for VEH registration and debug-register manipulation in scripting hosts
- Demonstrating alternative AMSI bypass patterns for training/lab environments
