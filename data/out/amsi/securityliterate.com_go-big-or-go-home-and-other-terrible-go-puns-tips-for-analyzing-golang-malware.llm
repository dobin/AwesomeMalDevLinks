Title:
Go Big or Go Home (and Other Terrible Go Puns): Tips for Analyzing GoLang Malware

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post summarizes practical tips for reverse engineering and triaging Golang malware, based on a livestream discussion.  
- It explains why Go is attractive to malware authors (cross-compilation, static linking, goroutines) and why that complicates analysis (large binaries, lots of benign stdlib code, and obfuscation).  
- The author walks through analyzing a simple Go binary in IDA, highlighting how modern disassemblers can recognize Go packages and how the main logic often lives in `main.main` / `main_main`.  
- It covers Go-specific reversing pitfalls like non–null-terminated strings (string value + length) that can confuse string views and decompilers.  
- For Garble-obfuscated binaries, it suggests pivoting off recognizable runtime symbols (e.g., `runtime_*` functions) and using xrefs to locate the real “main” logic even when symbols are stripped.  
- It recommends tooling and workflows (IDA/Ghidra + GoReSym, UnGarbler, static + dynamic analysis) and focusing on suspicious API usage patterns (networking, process execution, HTTP).

Technical Focus:
- Go binary structure (runtime, packages, `main.main`)
- Static linking and “noise” from Go standard library
- Garble obfuscation effects (symbol/name stripping, metadata removal)
- Go string internals (length-prefixed strings)
- Disassembler support and symbol recovery (IDA, Ghidra, GoReSym)
- Xref-driven navigation via `runtime_*` functions

Use Cases:
- Rapid triage of suspected Go malware to find core logic
- Locating entry-point behavior in Garble-obfuscated samples
- Improving Ghidra/IDA analysis with Go symbol recovery tooling
- Identifying malicious functionality by hunting for key Go stdlib/API patterns (`net`, `os/exec`, `http`)
- Building a repeatable static+dynamic workflow for Go-based threats
