Title:
PICO-Implant — Modular multi-stage C2 implant PoC using Position-independent Code Objects (PICO)

GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- PICO-Implant is a proof-of-concept Windows C2 implant architecture built around Position-independent Code Objects (PICOs) to enable modular, in-memory loaded functionality.  
- It demonstrates a three-stage execution chain (Stage 1 loader → Stage 2 remote PICO loader → Stage 3 implant core) with staged cleanup to reduce in-memory artifacts.  
- The implant is split into separate PICOs for transport/communications, an entry/task loop, and an obfuscation module.  
- It integrates LibTP with an enhanced LibGate to perform indirect syscalls and apply callstack spoofing/obfuscation, aiming to reduce user-mode API hooking visibility (EDR evasion tradecraft).  
- Sleep obfuscation is implemented via the Ekko technique.  
- Useful for red teamers and malware researchers exploring modular implant design, staged loaders, and stealthy syscall/callstack techniques; also relevant to blue teams for understanding emerging implant construction patterns.

Technical Focus:
- Position-independent Code Objects (PICO) and in-memory module loading
- Multi-stage loader design with memory cleanup between stages
- Indirect syscalls (LibGate) and API call obfuscation (LibTP)
- Call stack spoofing/obfuscation for user-mode EDR evasion
- Sleep obfuscation (Ekko)
- WinHTTP-based HTTP/HTTPS transport scaffolding

Use Cases:
- Prototype a modular implant where capabilities are delivered as remotely hosted PICOs
- Research staged execution flows and artifact reduction via stage self-removal
- Experiment with indirect syscalls + callstack spoofing to study EDR telemetry gaps
- Build a lab PoC for detecting PICO-style loaders and in-memory module execution
- Compare sleep obfuscation approaches (Ekko) against endpoint monitoring
