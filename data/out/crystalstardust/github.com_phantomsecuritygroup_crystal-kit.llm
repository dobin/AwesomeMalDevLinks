Title:
Crystal Kit (Crystal-Kit) – Crystal Palace PICO-based evasion primitives for Cobalt Strike

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Crystal Kit is an evasion kit for Cobalt Strike that experiments with replacing built-in Beacon evasion primitives (Sleepmask/BeaconGate) with a Crystal Palace PICO module.  
- It targets advanced detection/evasion scenarios by shifting how Beacon performs key behaviors (e.g., sleeping, gating, and related runtime artifacts) away from default CS implementations that are commonly signatured.  
- The repo provides multiple loaders (standard, local, post-ex) and a Cobalt Strike aggressor script (`crystalkit.cna`) to integrate the PICO workflow into operator tooling.  
- Usage requires disabling certain Malleable C2 stage obfuscations/sleepmask settings and loading the provided JAR/CNA into the CS client.  
- It’s primarily useful for red teams and security researchers evaluating alternative Beacon execution/evasion tradecraft and how EDRs respond to non-standard primitives.  
- Interesting as a “technical and social experiment” assessing feasibility/desirability of swapping core Beacon internals for a third-party PICO approach.

Technical Focus:
- Cobalt Strike Beacon evasion primitives (Sleepmask, BeaconGate)
- Crystal Palace / PICO module integration
- Loader development (C/ASM) for payload execution
- Aggressor scripting (.cna) for operator integration
- Post-execution DLL handling and cleanup/smartinject settings
- API hooking / stack spoofing (per commit notes)

Use Cases:
- Integrate Crystal Palace PICO into Cobalt Strike operations for testing evasion changes
- Compare EDR detections against default Beacon vs. modified primitives
- Build/modify loaders for alternative in-memory execution paths
- Research post-ex tradecraft compatibility with non-standard Beacon internals
