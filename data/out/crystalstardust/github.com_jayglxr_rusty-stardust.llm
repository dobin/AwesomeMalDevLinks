Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Rusty-Stardust is a Rust port of the original Stardust project, providing a 32/64-bit Windows shellcode template focused on position-independent code (PIC) development.  
- It solves the problem of building reliable, minimal-footprint shellcode with modern tooling while keeping classic shellcode design patterns (code/data separation, PEB-based resolution) intact.  
- The project implements compile-time FNV-1a string hashing for module/API resolution, raw string embedding, and a `no_std` setup to reduce dependencies and size.  
- It uses a Docker/MinGW/NASM build pipeline plus linker scripts and Cargo configuration to strip debug/exception sections and produce clean `.bin` shellcode via `objcopy`.  
- Useful for red teamers, exploit developers, and security researchers who want a maintainable Rust-based shellcode framework and a reference implementation of Windows PIC techniques.  
- Interesting because it demonstrates practical Rust shellcode engineering (including x86/x64 differences) while preserving deterministic extraction and layout control.

Technical Focus:
- Windows position-independent code (RIP-relative addressing, PIC patterns)
- PEB walking for module enumeration and resolution
- Hash-based API resolution (compile-time FNV-1a)
- `no_std` Rust shellcode development and minimal runtime
- Linker scripts/Cargo flags for stripping `.pdata/.xdata/.debug*` and disabling SEH
- Cross-compilation pipeline (Docker + MinGW + NASM + objcopy)

Use Cases:
- Build custom Windows x86/x64 shellcode payloads in Rust
- Create loaders that resolve APIs without import tables (stealthy resolution)
- Educational reference for PIC + PEB traversal + PE export parsing
- Generate small, extractable shellcode binaries for testing in harnesses (e.g., included “stomper”)
- Rapid prototyping of shellcode features with Rust tooling and reproducible builds
