Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
Crystal Kit is an evasion-focused add-on for Cobalt Strike that experiments with replacing Cobalt Strike’s built-in evasion primitives (Sleepmask/BeaconGate) with a Crystal Palace PICO implementation. The goal is to evaluate whether alternative in-memory concealment and execution “primitives” provide better resilience against modern EDR detections than stock Beacon mechanisms. It integrates into a Cobalt Strike workflow via an Aggressor script (`crystalkit.cna`) and requires placing `crystalpalace.jar` in the client directory, with Malleable C2 settings adjusted to disable default sleep mask and stage obfuscation. The repo includes multiple loaders (standard, local, and post-ex) and low-level components (C/assembly) consistent with custom in-process execution and API interception. It’s primarily useful for red teams and security researchers testing advanced Beacon evasion tradeoffs and operational stability. It’s interesting because it explicitly treats evasion as swappable “primitives” and explores Crystal Palace PICO as a drop-in alternative to common Cobalt Strike patterns.

Technical Focus:
- Cobalt Strike evasion primitives (Sleepmask, BeaconGate) replacement
- Crystal Palace PICO integration (`crystalpalace.jar`)
- Loader development (in-memory loading / post-execution loaders)
- API hooking/interception (e.g., WinINet `HttpSendRequestA`)
- Malleable C2 configuration changes for staging/obfuscation behavior

Use Cases:
- Swap out default Beacon sleep masking with alternative PICO-based evasion for testing
- Evaluate EDR detection differences between stock BeaconGate/Sleepmask and Crystal Palace primitives
- Build/modify custom loaders for Beacon/post-ex DLL execution paths
- Research and prototype userland API-hooking strategies around Beacon network I/O
- Develop repeatable lab experiments for “evasion primitive” A/B comparisons
