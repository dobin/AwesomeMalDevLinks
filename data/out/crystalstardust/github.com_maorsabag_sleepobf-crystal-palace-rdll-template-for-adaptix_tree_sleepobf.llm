Title:
SleepObf – Crystal Palace RDLL template for Adaptix (SleepObf branch)

Type:
GitHub Tool (repository/branch reference)

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
The provided link points to a GitHub branch/path that currently returns a 404/permission error, so the repository contents (README/code) are not accessible from the extracted page. Based on the URL naming, it appears intended to be a “SleepObf” (sleep obfuscation) implementation packaged as a “Crystal Palace” RDLL (Reflective DLL) template for the Adaptix framework. This likely targets evasion of EDR telemetry during beacon sleep by obfuscating or altering sleep behavior and/or in-memory artifacts. Without access to the actual files, specific techniques (e.g., NtDelayExecution vs. waitable timers, APC-based sleep, stack spoofing, memory encryption) cannot be confirmed. It would primarily be useful to red teams/pentesters and malware developers working on stealthy in-memory implants and loader templates.

Technical Focus:
- Sleep obfuscation / beacon sleep evasion (inferred)
- Reflective DLL (RDLL) loader/template (inferred)
- In-memory stealth / anti-EDR tradecraft (inferred)

Use Cases:
- Building an RDLL-based payload template for an implant framework (inferred)
- Reducing behavioral detections around periodic sleep/idle loops (inferred)
- Integrating sleep-evasion primitives into Adaptix-based tooling (inferred)
