Crystal Palace (Tradecraft Garden)

Type:
Documentation / Other (Tool)

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Crystal Palace is a custom linker and linker-script language designed for building position-independent DLL and COFF loaders.  
- It targets common engineering problems encountered when turning “tradecraft ideas” into reusable, PIC-capable loader components.  
- The project provides a specialized linking workflow and scripting interface (with docs, quick reference, and a JavaDoc API) to control how loader artifacts are produced.  
- It is primarily useful for red team operators, offensive tool developers, and malware developers who need reliable position-independent loading stubs and COFF/DLL loader builds.  
- Its value is in standardizing and simplifying the build/link stage for PIC loaders, which is often a brittle part of custom loader development.

Technical Focus:
- Position-independent code (PIC) for Windows loaders
- DLL loader construction and linking
- COFF object loading and linking
- Custom linker script language / build specification
- Tooling/API-driven link specifications (JavaDoc LinkSpec)

Use Cases:
- Building custom position-independent DLL loaders for offensive tooling
- Producing COFF loader artifacts for in-memory execution frameworks
- Standardizing linker behavior across multiple loader projects
- Rapid iteration on loader layouts/sections via linker scripts
