Title:
Stardust — Modern 32/64-bit Position-Independent Shellcode/Implant Template

Type:
GitHub Tool

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Stardust is a C++20 template for building small, position-independent Windows x86/x64 shellcode-style implants.  
- It solves common shellcode constraints by avoiding standard imports and instead resolving modules and APIs at runtime via the PEB.  
- The project uses compile-time FNV-1a hashing for module/function name lookup and provides “raw string” helpers to embed strings safely in PIC code.  
- It includes a structured “instance” pattern for declaring required DLLs/APIs and auto-resolving them, plus optional debug output via DbgPrint when built in debug mode.  
- Build tooling targets MinGW and outputs raw `.bin` payloads for both architectures.  
- Useful primarily for red team operators, exploit developers, and malware researchers who need a clean starting point for custom shellcode/implants and API resolution patterns.

Technical Focus:
- Position-independent code (PIC) shellcode/implant design (x86/x64)
- PEB-based module enumeration and dynamic API resolution
- Compile-time hashing (FNV-1a) for import/name obfuscation
- Raw string embedding helpers for shellcode constraints
- Minimal import footprint / custom “import table” via resolver macros
- Debugging shellcode with DbgPrint (debug builds)

Use Cases:
- Building custom Windows shellcode loaders/implants with runtime API resolution
- Creating PoCs that need small, dependency-free payloads (x86 and x64)
- Rapid prototyping of new capability modules (adding DLL/API entries to the instance)
- Researching/demonstrating PEB-walking and hashed import resolution techniques
- Generating raw `.bin` payloads for injection frameworks or exploit chains
