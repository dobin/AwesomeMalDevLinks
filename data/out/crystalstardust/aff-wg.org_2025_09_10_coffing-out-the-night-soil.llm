Title:
Coffing Out the Night Soil (Tradecraft Garden / Crystal Palace update)

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post announces a Tradecraft Garden release focused on the Crystal Palace linker, specifically a rebuilt COFF parser, an intermediate COFF representation, and COFF normalization (e.g., collapsing related sections).  
- It adds standard linker-like capabilities: merging COFF objects via a `merge` command and exporting normalized COFF output via `make coff`, driven by a `.spec` “linker script” workflow.  
- The goal is to better separate “capability assembly” (building modular agent components from COFF/BOF-style objects) from later “tradecraft application,” aligning with modular PIC agent concepts.  
- It positions PICOs (Crystal Palace’s executable COFF convention) as a compact, mutable container that pairs with a simple position-independent runner/loader, enabling transformations like function shuffling and dead-code removal.  
- Migration notes cover a breaking change in x86 PIC relocation handling (now gated behind `reladdr "_symbol"`) and an updated `picorun.h` to support relocations in PICO data.  
- Useful primarily for red team toolsmiths and offensive R&D engineers building modular, position-independent payloads and custom loaders.

Technical Focus:
- COFF parsing, intermediate representation, and normalization
- Linker-script style build specifications (`.spec`)
- COFF object merging and COFF export (`merge`, `make coff`)
- Position-independent code (PIC) and relocations (x86/x64)
- PICO executable COFF convention and PICO runner/loader (`picorun.h`)
- Binary transformation/mutation pipeline (shuffle, remove unused functions)

Use Cases:
- Assemble modular agent capabilities from multiple COFF objects (kernel/C2/utils) before applying loader/evasion tradecraft
- Generate normalized COFF artifacts for downstream processing or conversion into PICO containers
- Build and test custom BOF/PIC-style modules with a repeatable linker-script workflow
- Develop simpler PIC loaders by pushing merge/relocation complexity into the linker
- Apply binary transformations to compiled modules to change layout and reduce unused code
