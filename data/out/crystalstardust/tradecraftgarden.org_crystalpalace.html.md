## Crystal Palace

Crystal Palace is a linker and linker script language specialized to the needs of writing position-independent DLL and COFF loaders.

The name is inspired by [The Crystal Palace](https://www.popsci.com/technology/crystal-palace-mystery/), a former cast-iron and glass structure built in London for the Great Exhibition of 1851. At the time, it was the world's largest building. The Crystal Palace adopted a standard size and thread for screws and demonstrated the efficiency gains from building with a standard.

Like The Crystal Palace, this project aims to solve common problems in turning tradecraft ideas into position-independent capability loaders.
