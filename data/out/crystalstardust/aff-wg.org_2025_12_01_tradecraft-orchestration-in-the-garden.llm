Title:
Tradecraft Orchestration in the Garden

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post describes a new Tradecraft Garden / Crystal Palace release focused on better separating “base architecture” from “tradecraft” when building position-independent code (PIC/PICO) loaders and capabilities.  
- It introduces `%variables` as a templating mechanism in Crystal Palace spec files, enabling reusable base specs where tradecraft modules are selected and injected later via CLI, config specs, or a Java API.  
- New orchestration primitives (`echo`, `setg`/`set`, `pack`, `foreach`, `next`) support layering and chaining multiple tradecraft modules dynamically.  
- Modularity is expanded with positional arguments to `run`, callable labels, and `call` to define stable “contracts” (interfaces) for tradecraft modules within or across spec files.  
- It also addresses practical build issues like deterministic path handling via `resolve` and CLI `-r`.  
- Useful for red team toolsmiths and offensive R&D engineers building modular loaders, hook frameworks, and composable tradecraft pipelines.

Technical Focus:
- Crystal Palace specification language enhancements (%variables, scoping, templating)
- Modular PIC/PICO loader composition and tradecraft/capability separation
- Orchestration primitives: foreach/next chaining, run/call with positional args
- Data marshalling with `pack` into byte arrays ($VARIABLE)
- File path canonicalization and resolution (`resolve`, CLI `-r`)
- Java API integration for build-time configuration injection

Use Cases:
- Build a reusable PIC loader “base” and swap tradecraft modules per operation
- Chain multiple tradecraft stages (e.g., hook module → stack cutting module) via `next`
- Layer optional libraries/modules into a build using `foreach` over a variable list
- Encapsulate tradecraft modules behind callable-label contracts for consistent integration
- Manage environment-/target-specific build configs via `@config.spec` and global variables
