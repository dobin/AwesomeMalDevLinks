Tradecraft Garden

## Planting a Ground Truth Security Science

The Tradecraft Garden is a collection of projects to decompose evasion tradecraft into self-contained units of execution, separate from (but usable with) C2 frameworks. These tradecrafts, separated from capability, are security ground truth. These ground truth outputs have uses for:

- Breach and Attack Simulation
- Detection Engineering
- EDR Test and Evaluation
- Security Testing Exercises

The broader goal of Tradecraft Garden is to:

- inform the security conversation
- serve as a public good resource for others to build on
- demonstrate ideas, in context, while serving multiple security use cases and communities

### Projects

Tradecraft Garden's projects include:

- [Crystal Palace](https://tradecraftgarden.org/crystalpalace.html): A linker, linker script language, and Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) tools for position-independent code projects.
- [The Tradecraft Garden](https://tradecraftgarden.org/tradecraft.html): A corpora of in-memory evasion tradecraft, both load and runtime, packaged into capability loaders and shared libraries.
