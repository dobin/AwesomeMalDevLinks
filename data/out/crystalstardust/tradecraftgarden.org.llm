Title:
Tradecraft Garden — Planting a Ground Truth Security Science

Type:
Documentation / Project Hub (Security Tooling Collection)

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- Tradecraft Garden is a collection of projects that decomposes evasion tradecraft into self-contained execution units that are independent of (but compatible with) C2 frameworks.  
- The goal is to produce “ground truth” artifacts for repeatable security testing rather than bundling techniques inside opaque operator tooling.  
- It targets in-memory evasion tradecraft (load-time and runtime) and packages these techniques into capability loaders and shared libraries.  
- A companion project, Crystal Palace, provides a linker/linker-script language and Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) tooling aimed at position-independent code (PIC) projects and instrumentation.  
- The outputs are positioned for breach-and-attack simulation, detection engineering, and EDR test/evaluation, enabling defenders and testers to validate detections against well-defined technique units.  
- It’s interesting because it emphasizes modular, reusable, technique-focused artifacts (including COFF/PIC workflows) that can be orchestrated outside traditional C2 ecosystems.

Technical Focus:
- In-memory evasion tradecraft (load-time and runtime)
- Capability loaders and shared-library packaging
- Position-independent code (PIC/PICO) build and instrumentation
- Custom linker + linker script language
- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) for tradecraft engineering
- COFF normalization/merge/export and binary transformation workflows

Use Cases:
- Build repeatable EDR evaluation test cases from isolated technique units
- Generate BAS scenarios that don’t depend on a specific C2 framework
- Develop and regression-test detection logic against “ground truth” artifacts
- Prototype and instrument PIC-based payload components and loaders
- Research modular tradecraft orchestration via spec files and variables
