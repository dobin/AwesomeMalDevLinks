Title:
Planting a Tradecraft Garden

Type:
Blog Post

Short Summary (4–8 sentences max):
- This post introduces “Tradecraft Garden,” a set of projects aimed at making position-independent (PIC) Windows DLL loaders easier to build, extend, and use as containers for post-exploitation/evasion research.  
- The author describes how earlier work on exception handlers and page-permission “page streaming” for in-memory payload masking exposed practical engineering gaps (global state, bundling multiple resources, PIC-friendly linking).  
- Two main components are highlighted: **Crystal Palace**, a specialized linker + linker-script language to access appended resources via symbols and to run COFF modules via a BOF-like convention (“PICOs”); and **The Tradecraft Garden**, a curated set of well-commented, hackable loader examples demonstrating patterns and Crystal Palace features.  
- The core problem addressed is the friction of expressing advanced tradecraft as position-independent code, which has slowed public exploration of user-defined reflective loaders and related techniques.  
- It’s useful for red team toolsmiths, offensive security researchers, and (indirectly) defenders who want reproducible “ground truth” artifacts to study detection gaps deeper in the attack chain.  
- The post frames the project as an enabling platform to decouple tradecraft from specific C2 products and to re-energize open, reusable research conventions.

Technical Focus:
- Position-independent code (PIC) DLL loader design
- Custom linking/linker scripts for appended resources and symbol access
- COFF/BOF-style module execution from PIC (“PICOs”)
- Reflective loading / user-defined reflective loader conventions
- In-memory evasion primitives (exceptions, page permissions, “page streaming”)
- Packaging tradecraft as reusable research artifacts independent of C2

Use Cases:
- Build and iterate on custom reflective/PIC DLL loaders without typical resource/global-variable pain
- Package multiple embedded resources (payloads/config/stagers) into a single PIC artifact
- Execute COFF modules from within PIC loaders (BOF-like workflows)
- Create reproducible loader-based PoCs for studying in-memory evasion and detection coverage
- Provide standardized artifacts for defensive testing, detonation, and telemetry gap analysis
